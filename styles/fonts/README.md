## DP Sans Mono

[DP Sans Mono](https://www.pgdp.net/wiki/DP_Sans_Mono) is a font created by
DP volunteer lvl with feedback from numerous other volunteers. It is derived
from DejaVu Sans Mono (see below) and is under the
[DP Sans Mono License](DP%20Sans%20Mono%20License.txt). This is version "Draft 14".

Various characters have been tweaked to help disambiguate them from
similar-looking characters.

This font is the spiritual successor to DPCustomMono2.

The font is available as a
[True-Type Font](https://github.com/DistributedProofreaders/dproofreaders/raw/master/styles/fonts/DPSansMono.ttf)
for download and local install.
