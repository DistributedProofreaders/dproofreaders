<h3><a name="prime">The Primary Rule</a> </h3>
<p> In doing your proofreading, the primary rule to follow is that the final electronic
    book seen by a reader, possibly many years in the future, should <b>accurately
    convey the intent of the author</b>. </p>
<p> So the general rule is <em>"Don't change what the author wrote!"</em>.  If the
    author spelled words oddly, leave them spelled that way.  If the author wrote
    outrageous racist or biased statements, leave them that way. If the author seems to
    put italics or a footnote every third word, leave them italicized or footnoted. </p>
<p> On the other hand, we do change minor printing items that don't affect the sense of
    what the author wrote.  For example, typesetters in the 1700's &amp; 1800's often
    inserted a &frac34;ths space before punctuation such as a semicolon or comma.  Our OCR
    scanners generally read this as a space character.  When proofreading, we remove
    that; since it distracts modern readers and removing this space doesn't affect the
    meaning of the author's words.  Typesetters of that time also used the "long s" in
    words, which looks similar to an "f".  In English, the "long s" and the regular "s"
    are the same, so we make them all the regular "s". </p>

<h3><a name="summary">Summary Guidelines</a>                   </h3>
<p> The <a href="summary.pdf">Summary of Guidelines</a> is a short, 2-page
    printer-friendly (.pdf) document that summarizes the main points of these
    Guidelines, and gives examples of how to proofread.  Beginning Proofreaders are
    encouraged to print out this document and keep it handy while proofing.


<h3><a name="about">About This Document</a> </h3>
<p> This document is written in order to resolve formatting differences done by
    proofreaders on a variety of items; so that we all do formatting <em>the same
    way</em>.  This makes the post-proofreader's work easier and will increase the
    quality of the books that are created through this site.  But it's not intended as
    any kind of a general editorial or typesetting rulebook. </p>
<p> We've included in this document all the items that new users have asked about
    formatting while proofreading.  If there are any items missing, or items that you
    consider should be done differently, or if something is vague, please let us know.
    </p>
<p> This document is a work in progress. Help us to progress by sending in your
    suggested changes. </p>

<h3><a name="comments">Project Comments</a> </h3>

<p> On the interface page where you start proofing pages, there is a section called
    "Project Comments" containing info specific to that project (book). <em>Read these
    before you start proofing pages!</em> If the Project Manager wants you to format
    something in this book different than the general rules in these Guidelines, that
    will be noted here.  Instructions in the Project Comments <em>override</em> the rules
    in these Guidelines, so follow them.  (This is also where the Project Manager gives
    you interesting tidbits of information about the books, like where the source came
    from, etc.) </p>

<h3><a name="forums">Forum/Discuss this Project</a> </h3>
<p> On the interface page where you start proofing pages, on the line "Forum", there is
    a link titled "Discuss this Project".  Clicking on that link will take you to a
    forum for this specific project. That is the place to ask questions about this book,
    inform the Project Manager about problems, etc.  Using this Forum is the recommended
    way to communicate with the Project Manager and other proofreaders who are working
    on this book. </p>

<h3><a name="prev_pg">Fixing errors on Previous Pages</a> </h3>
<p> For each book you've worked on, the last 5 pages that you proofed are available from
    the project page for that book under the heading "My Recently Proofread".  If you
    discover that you made a mistake on a page, or marked something incorrectly, you can
    click on that page here and re-open it to fix the error.  (If it's already gone by,
    then use the  <a href="#forums">project forum</a> to leave a note for the next round.)

<h3><a name="title_pg"><b>Front/Back Title Page</b></a> </h3>
<p> Leave only the title and author name, since due to Project Gutenberg procedures,
    that is all that will be put into the title page for final release of the e-book.
    Remove all references to year, city of publication, publisher, copyright date, etc.
    Put the title &amp; author name just as the book has it written, whether all
    capitals, upper &amp; lower case, etc.  Older books often show the first letter as a
    large &amp; ornate graphic--put this as just the letter.  (These pages are left in
    to simplify uploading of the project and for the folder to have the complete book in
    it for future reference.)</p>

<h3><a name="blank_pg">Blank Page</a> </h3>
<p>Blank pages may be in the project you are working on due to the original book having
    a blank page and us trying to cut down on the work needed to find the page, remove
    it, and renumber the remaining pages.  Please put in the text box <tt>[Blank
    Page]</tt> if both the text box and the image are blank. If only one of them is
    blank, follow the directions for a <a href="#bad_image">Bad Image</a> or <a
     href="#bad_text">Bad Text</a>. </p>

<h3><a name="page_hf">Page Headers/Page Footers</a> </h3>
<p> Remove page headers and page footers (but not <a href="#footnotes">footnotes</a>)
    from the text. The page headers are normally at the top of the image and have a page
    number opposite them.  Page headers may be the same all through the book (often the
    title of the book and the authors name); they may be the same for each chapter
    (often the chapter number); or they may be different on each page (describing the
    action on that page).  Remove them all, regardless.
  <br>
    A <a href="#chap_head">chapter header</a> will start farther down the page and won't
    have the page numbers on the same line. Leave chapter headers in--see below. </p>

          KINDS AND USES.--If a man wishes to buy some commodity                     <br>
          from another but has not the money to pay for                              <br>
          it, he may secure what he wants by giving his written                      <br>
          promise to pay at some future time. This written                           <br>
          promise, or &lt;i&gt;note&lt;/i&gt;, the seller prefers to an oral promise <br>

          for several reasons, only two of which need be mentioned                   <br>
          here: first, because it is &lt;i&gt;prima facie&lt;/i&gt; evidence of      <br>
          the debt; and, second, because it may be more easily                       <br>
          transferred or handed over to some one else.                               <br>

                                                                                     <br>
          If J. M. Johnson, of Saint Paul, owes C. M. Jones,                         <br>
          of Chicago, a hundred dollars, and Nelson Blake, of                        <br>
          Chicago, owes J. M. Johnson a hundred dollars, it is                       <br>
          plain that the risk, expense, time and trouble of sending                  <br>
          the money to and from Chicago may be avoided,                              <br>

<h3><a name="chap_head">Chapter Headers</a> </h3>
<p> Leave chapter headers in the text. A chapter header will start a bit farther down
    the page than the <a href="#page_hf">page header</a> and won't have the page numbers
    on the same line.  Chapter Headers are often printed all caps, if so, keep them as
    all caps. Include 4 blank lines before the "CHAPTER XXX", and 2 blank lines after,
    between it and the chapter description.
  <br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

    Old books often printed the first word of every chapter in all caps, sometimes even
    the first word of every paragraph; change these to a normal word (first letter only
    capitalized), unless it's <a href="#bold">bold text</a>.
  <br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    Watch out for a missing double quote at the start of the first paragraph, which some
    publishers did not include or which the OCR missed due to a large capital in the
    original.  If the author started the paragraph with dialog, insert the double quote,
    even if the publisher left it out or used a large capital instead.

                <br>
          A solitary figure trudged along the narrow            <br>
          road that wound its serpentinous way                  <br>
          through the dismal, forbidding depths of              <br>
          the forest: a man who, though weary and footsore,     <br>

          lagged not in his swift, resolute advance. Night      <br>
          was coming on, and with it the no uncertain           <br>
          prospects of storm. Through the foliage that overhung <br>
          the wretched road, his ever-lifting and apprehensive  <br>
          eye caught sight of the thunder-black, low-lying      <br>
          clouds that swept over the mountain and bore          <br>

          down upon the green, whistling tops of the trees.     <br>
                <br>
          At a cross-road below he had encountered a small     <br>
          girl driving homeward the cows. She was afraid       <br>
          of the big, strange man with the bundle on his back  <br>
          and the stout walking stick in his hand: to her a    <br>

          remarkable creature who wore "knee pants" and        <br>
          stockings like a boy on Sunday, and hob-nail shoes,  <br>
          and a funny coat with "pleats" and a belt, and a     <br>
          green hat with a feather sticking up from the band.

<h3><a name="para_side">Paragraph Side-Descriptions</a> </h3>
<p> Some books will have short descriptions of the paragraph along the side of the text.
    Move these "Sidenotes" to just above the paragraph that they belong to, surrounded
    with <tt>[Sidenote: the-description-text]</tt>.  If the paragraph began on a
    previous page, put the Sidenote at the top of the page and mark if with <tt>*</tt>
    so that the post-proofreader can see that it belongs on the previous page.  Like
    this: <tt>*[Sidenote: the-description-text]</tt>. If there are multiple sidenotes
    for a single paragraph, put them one after another at the start of the paragraph. </p>

          two things that are alike cannot be distinguished,      <br>

          objects cannot be seen or recognised by                 <br>
          the eye. Light is total contrary and gives              <br>
          more distinctness, and counteracts and differs          <br>
          from the usual darkness of the eye, hence               <br>

<h3><a name="para_space">Paragraph Spacing/Indenting</a> </h3>
<p> Do not indent the start of paragraphs; instead put a blank line between paragraphs.
    See the <a href="#chap_head">Chapter Headers</a> image/text for an example. (But if
    all paragraphs are already indented, don't bother removing those spaces--that can be
    done automatically in post-proofing.) </p>

<h3><a name="mult_col">Multiple Columns</a> </h3>
<p> Break up multiple-column text into a single column.  Place the left-most column
    first and then the next one after it, and so on. You don't need to do anything
    to mark where the columns were split, just run them all together.
    </p>

<h3><a name="illust">Illustrations</a> </h3>
<p> Text for an illustration should be surrounded by <tt>[Illustration: the-text]</tt>.
    If there is no text, just place <tt>[Illustration]</tt> there. If it is in the
    middle of a paragraph or on the side of a paragraph, move the <tt>[Illustration:
    the-text] </tt>to either above or below the paragraph, based on where you can put it
    without it being in the middle of a paragraph. </p>

<h3><a name="footnotes">Footnotes/Endnotes</a> </h3>
<p> Replace the footnote number, *, dagger, etc. that marks a footnote location with the
    actual text of the footnote, surrounded by <tt>[Footnote: ]</tt>.  That is,
    footnotes should be be moved from the bottom of the page to the place on the page
    where they are referenced in the text.  Many proofreaders put a line break before
    the <tt>[Footnote:</tt> and another one after the <tt>]</tt> that ends the footnote,
    because this makes it easier for the Second Round Proofer. </p>

<p> If a footnote was a continuation of a footnote from a previous page, move it to the
    top of the page, surround it with <tt>[Footnote: ]</tt>, and put a <tt>*</tt> before
    it. If a footnote continues on the next page, it should be moved to where it is
    referenced on the page, surrounded by <tt>[Footnote: ]</tt>, and marked with a
    <tt>*</tt> at the end of it.  If a footnote/endnote is referenced in the text but
    does not appear on that page, keep the footnote/endnote number or marker and
    surround it with <tt>[Footnote: ]</tt> and put a <tt>*</tt> next to it so the
    post-proofer can find it. See the <a href="#page_hf">Page Headers/Footers</a>

    image/text for an example footnote.</p>
<p> <b>Footnotes in Poetry or Tables</b> should be put on a separate line at the end of a stanza,
    or at the end of the poem (just after the closing <tt>*/</tt>), so as not to
    interrupt the flow of the Author's poetry. The same applies to Footnotes in Tables;
    put them at the bottom of the table so as not to mess up the table format.</p>

<p> <b>Endnotes</b> are just footnotes that have been located together at the end of a chapter
    or at the end of the book, instead of on the bottom of each page.  If you are
    proofing a page with endnotes on it, keep the footnote number, but otherwise mark
    them just like other footnotes: surrounded by <tt>[Footnote: ]</tt>.  Put a blank
    line after each one, so that they stay separate paragraphs when the text is
    reflowed in post-processing. </p>
<!-- Need an example of Endnotes, maybe? -->

<h3><a name="italics">Italics</a> </h3>
<p> Text that is italicized should have <tt>&lt;i&gt;</tt> inserted at the start and
    <tt>&lt;/i&gt;</tt> inserted at the end of the italics. (Note the "/" in the closing
    symbol.) If the italics start at the top of a page, place a <tt>*</tt> in front of
    the <tt>&lt;i&gt;</tt> so that the post-proofreader can see if there was more on the
    previous page. If the italics go to the bottom of a page, place a <tt>*</tt> after
    the <tt>&lt;/i&gt;</tt> so that the post-proofreader can see if there is more on the
    next page.
  <br>

    (Note: either lower-case <tt>&lt;i&gt;</tt> or upper-case <tt>&lt;I&gt;</tt> is
    OK, whichever you prefer.) </p>
<p>
    Punctuation goes
    OUTSIDE the italics, unless it is an entire sentence or section that is being
    italicized. That is not a big deal, but is an answer for those curious.
  <br>
    See the <a
    href="#illust">Illustration</a> image for an example of how to do the italics.
    </p>

<p>
    Many fonts, especially older ones, used the same design for numbers in both regular
    and italics.  So for dates &amp; similar phrases, just mark the whole phrase as
    italics, rather than marking the words as italics and the numbers as non-italics.
    For example:
    </p>

<h3><a name="bold">Bold Text</a> </h3>
<p> Change bold text into all capitals.  (Except if it's the <a href="#chap_head">first
    word of a chapter</a> -- then only capitalize it if it's in bold.) See the <a
    href="#page_hf">Page Headers/Footers</a> image/text for an example.
  <br>

    Do not mark bold text HTML-style (surrounded with <tt>&lt;b&gt;</tt> and
    <tt>&lt;/b&gt;</tt>) unless the Project Manager specifies this method in the <a
    href="#comments">Project Comments</a>. </p>

<h3><a name="supers">Superscripts</a> </h3>
<p> Older books often abbreviated words as contractions, and printed them as
    superscripts, for example: <font color="red">

    <br> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Gen<sup>rl</sup>
    Washington defeated L<sup>d</sup> Cornwall's army. <br>    </font>
    Unless the <a href="#comments">Project Comments</a> specify something else, insert a
    single quote (apostrophe) to identify this as an abbreviation/contraction, like
    this: <br> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;    <tt>Gen'rl Washington defeated L'd
    Cornwall's army.</tt> <br> Only change to the full word if the <a
    href="#comments">Project Comments</a> specifically say to do so, like this: <br>

    &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <tt>General Washington defeated Lord Cornwall's
    army.</tt> </p>

<h3><a name="underl">Underlined Text</a> </h3>
<p> Mark as <a href="#italics">Italics</a>, with <tt>&lt;i&gt;</tt> and
    <tt>&lt;/i&gt;</tt>, unless the <a href="#comments">Project Comments</a> specify
    something else for this book.  Underlining was used to indicate italics when the
    typesetter was unable to actually italicize the text, for example in a typewritten
    document.  </p>

<h3><a name="#font_sz">Font size changes</a> </h3>
<p> Don't do anything to mark changes in font size.  When the book is converted to
    electronic form, it will all be plain ASCII text in the same font.   The exception
    to this is when the font size changes to indicate a section of <a
    href="#poetry">poetry</a> or <a href="#block_qt">block quotations</a>; then mark the
    text as specified for those (<tt>/*</tt> at the start, <tt>*/</tt> at the end, with
    poetry indented 2 spaces, block quotations indented 4 spaces). </p>

<h3><a name="word_caps">Word in all Caps</a> </h3>
<p> If a word or words in the text are printed in all capital letters, leave it that way
    in your proofed copy.  The exception to this is the <a href="#chap_head">first word
    of a chapter or paragraph</a>: many old books put the first word of these in all
    caps; this should be changed to a normal word (first letter capitalized, the rest
    lower case). </p>

<h3><a name="eol_hyphen">End-of-line Hyphenation</a> </h3>
<p> Unless it really is a hyphenated word like well-meaning, remove the end-of-line
    hyphenation, and join the two halves of a previously hyphenated word back together.
    Keep the joined word on the top line, and put a line break after it to preserve the
    line formatting -- this makes it easier for the 2nd Round Proofreader.  See the <a
    href="#chap_head">Chapter Headers</a> image for examples of each kind
    (<tt>nar-row</tt> turns into <tt>narrow</tt>, but <tt>low-lying</tt> keeps the
    hyphen). Words like to-day and to-morrow that we don't commonly hyphenate now were
    often hyphenated in the old books we are working on.  Leave them hyphenated the way
    the author did. </p>

<h3><a name="eop_hyphen">End-of-page Hyphenation</a> </h3>
<p> Leave the hyphen at the end of the last line, but mark it with a <tt>*</tt> after
    the hyphen so the post-proofer will notice it. On pages that start with part of a
    word from a previous page, place a <tt>*</tt> before the word.</p>

<h3><a name="em_dashes">Dashes, Hyphens, and Minus Signs</a> </h3>

<p> Please use two minus signs with no space on either side for the em-dash. For longer
    dashes, use 4 hyphens (minus signs).  There are a few occasions where it is
    appropriate to leave the spaces, such as when the dash is being used instead of a
    name or number, as in Mr.  B---- or --- Charing Cross Rd.  If a dash appears at the
    start or end of a line of your OCR'd text, join it with the other line so that there
    are no spaces or line breaks around it.  Only if the author used a dash to start or
    end the paragraph or line of poetry or dialog should you leave it at the start or
    end of a line.
</p>
<p> Hyphens (a single minus sign) should appear in a proofed text only
    within a hyphenated-word, in a range like 1850-1900, or when
    actually used as a minus sign, as in -14&deg; or x - y = z.
 <!-- We could probably use an example here, better yet, examples of each of these. -->

<h3><a name="contract">Contractions</a> </h3>
<p> Remove any extra space in contractions, for example: <tt>would&nbsp;n't</tt> should
    be <tt>wouldn't</tt>.  (This was an early printers convention, where they retained
    the space to indicate that 'would' and 'not' were originally separate words.  If you
    see the extra space next to the apostrophe, (<tt>wouldn&nbsp;'t</tt>) that is
    probably an OCR scanning issue.  Remove the extra space in either case.) </p>

<h3><a name="poetry">Poetry/Epigrams</a> </h3>
<p> Mark poetry or epigrams so the post-processor can find the poetry quicker. Insert a
    separate line with <tt>/*</tt> at the start of the poetry or epigram and a separate
    line with <tt>*/</tt> at the end, and then indent each line in between by exactly 2
    spaces. If the poetry starts at the beginning of the page put a <tt>*</tt> before
    the <tt>/*</tt> so the post-proofer can check to see if it was continued from the
    previous page.  If it goes to the end of the page put a <tt>*</tt> after the
    <tt>*/</tt> so the post-proofer can check to see if it continues onto the next page.
    </p>

<p> Don't bother trying to center lines of poetry, even if it was centered on the
    printed page; that won't work for an e-book viewed with many different screen sizes.
    Just leave it all indented 2 spaces.  (If there is some other indenting that you
    think is needed to reflect the author's meaning, then try to duplicate the format of
    the original.  Try to start each stanza indented 2 spaces, and then format from
    there.)  But for most poetry, the meaning is in the words and line breaks; indenting
    format is not critical.
</p>
<p> <b>Footnotes</b> in poetry should go at the end of the poem or stanza.  See
    <a href="#footnotes">footnotes</a> for details.

<h3><a name="letter">Letter Indentation</a> </h3>
<p> Leave letters unindented, like you would for <a href="#para_space">paragraphs</a>.
    Instead of indenting put a blank line before the start of the letter. </p>

<h3><a name="tables">Tables</a> </h3>
<p> Mark tables so the post-processor can find them by surrounding them with <tt>/*</tt>
    and <tt>*/</tt>, like <a href="#poetry">poetry</a> above. Format the table with
    spaces to look approximately like the original table.  Don't make the table wider
    than 70 characters. <br> It's often hard to format tables in plain ASCII text; just
    do your best. </p>

<p> <b>Footnotes</b> in tables should go at the end of the table.  See
    <a href="#footnotes">footnotes</a> for details.
</p>

<h3><a name="block_qt">Block Quotations</a> </h3>
<p> These are long quotations (typically several lines) included in a book. They are
    often printed narrower (wider margins) and in a smaller font size.  Mark block
    quotations so the post-processor can find them by surrounding them with <tt>/*</tt>
    and <tt>*/</tt>, like <a href="#poetry">poetry</a> above.  Indent each line in the
    quotation by 4 spaces. </p>

<h3><a name="double_q">Double Quotes</a> </h3>
   <!-- This first sentence is unclear to me! -->
<p> Single spacing around quote marks and punctuation is the correct formatting for the
    text. Please try to just use the plain " double quote, since the directional double
    quotes [&ldquo; and &rdquo;]
    will have to be replaced to make it ASCII compliant. Do not change single
    quotes to double quotes.  See the <a href="#chap_head">Chapter Headers</a> image and
    text for an example.</p>

<h3><a name="single_q">Single Quotes</a> </h3>

<p> Single quotes are used for a variety of purposes.  They sometimes are used
    throughout where current usage would be double quotes--they should be left as
    printed.  They are also used for slang words or shortened versions (contractions).
    Try to put them the way the image shows them.  Last of all, please try to just use
    the plain ASCII <tt>'</tt> single quote (apostrophe) to make it easier for
    everyone.</p>

<h3><a name="period_s">Periods Between Sentences</a> </h3>
<p> Single space after periods (not two spaces). But don't bother to remove double
    spaces after periods if they're already in the scanned text -- we can do that
    automatically in post-processing.  See the <a href="#chap_head">Chapter Headers</a>
    image and text for an example. </p>

<h3><a name="punctuat">Punctuation characters</a> </h3>
<p> In general, there is no space before punctuation characters (except the opening
    quote). Books typeset in the 1700's &amp; 1800's often had a partial space inserted
    before punctuation such as a semicolon or comma.  If scanned text has a space before
    punctuation, remove it. </p>

<h3><a name="line_br">Line Breaks</a> </h3>
<p> Leave all line breaks in so that the next proofreader can compare the text easily.
    Especially watch this when fixing <a href="#eol_hyphen">hyphenated words</a>.  Extra
    blank lines that are not in the image should be removed.  But a blank line at
    the top or bottom of the page is OK--these are removed automatically in
    post-processing.  (Exceptions: the way we mark text for
    <a href="#footnotes">Footnotes</a>, and for
    <a href="#poetry">Poetry/Epigrams</a> will sometimes cause extra line breaks.)
    See the <a href="#chap_head">Chapter Headers</a> image and text for
    an example. </p>

<!-- We should have an example right here for this. -->

<h3><a name="extra_sp">Extra spaces Between Words</a> </h3>
<p> Extra spaces between words are a common OCR error.  You don't need to bother
    removing those spaces--that can be done automatically in post-proofing.  But extra
    spaces around punctuation, em-dashes, quote marks, etc. does need to be
    removed--that is hard to do automatically.  </p>

<h3><a name="line_no">Line Numbers</a> </h3>
<p> These are numbers in the margin for each line -- common in older technical books.
    Remove all such line numbers from the text. Since the text will be reformatted in
    the e-book version, they will not be helpful.</p>
<!-- We need an example image and text for this. -->

<h3><a name="extra_s">Extra Spacing/Stars/Line Between Paragraphs</a></h3>
<p> Some pages will have extra spacing between paragraphs due to "thought breaks",
    change in scene, or a bit of suspense. These are intended by the author, so we
    preserve them by putting a blank line, 5 *'s indented 7 spaces and then 7 spaces
    apart, like so:<br>
<tt><br>
end of the line of text.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*<br>
<br>
Text starts up again.</tt><br>

(The enhanced proofing interface has this separator available to cut
&amp; paste.) <br> See the <a href="#page_hf">Page Headers/Footers</a>
image/text for an example.</p>

<h3><a name="period_p">Period Pause "..."</a> </h3>
<p> Leave a space before the three dots, and a space after.  The exception is at the end
    of a sentence, when there would be no space, four dots, and a space after.  For
    example:
    <tt>
    <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That I know ... is true.
    <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is the end....
    </tt></p>

<h3><a name="a_chars">Accented/Non-ASCII Characters</a> </h3>
<p> Try to put in the proper accented or Non-ASCII characters. <br>
    But there is a problem with using accented characters -- they are upper
    ASCII, or characters above code 127. This can cause display problems for
    any computer not using the Western European character set (MS Windows
    codepage 1252 / ISO 8859-1 or -15). Furthermore, Apple never accepted
    ISO 8859 and some characters don't match up (a good example is the
    curly open quote (0147), which Apple maps to an accented capital O).
    Use with caution. </p>
<p> <b>For Windows</b>, there are several ways to get these characters: </p>
<ul compact>
  <li>you can use the character map program
     (Start: Run: charmap) to select an individual letter, and then cut &amp; paste.
  </li>

  <li>if using the enhanced proofing interface, the <i>more</i> tag creates a pop-up
      window containing these characters, which you can then cut &amp; paste.
  </li>
  <li>or you can type the Alt+NumberPad shortcut codes for these characters.
      <br>(They're a lot faster than using cut &amp; paste,
          once you get used to the codes.)
      <br>You hold the Alt key and type the four digits on the
          <i>Number Pad</i> -- the number row over the letters won't work.
      <br>And you must type all 4 digits, including the leading 0.
          Note that the capital version of a letter is 32 less than the lower case.
      <br>(This is for the US-English keyboard layout. It may not work for other keyboards.)
      <br>The table below shows the codes we use.
          (<a href="charwin.pdf">Print-friendly version of this table)</a>

      <br>Don't use other special characters unless the Project Manager tells you to in
          the <a href="#comments">Project Comments</a>.
  </li>

<p> <b>For Apple Macs</b>, there are also several ways to get these characters: </p>
<ul compact>
  <li>you can use the Apple Key Caps program as a reference.  (In OS 9 &amp; earlier, it's
      located in the Apple Menu; in OS X, it's located in Applications, Utilities folder.)
      This brings up a picture of the keyboard, and pressing shift, opt, command, or
      combinations of those keys shows how to produce each character.  Use this
      reference to see how to type that character, or you can cut &amp; paste it from
      here to the document.
  </li>
  <li>if using the enhanced proofing interface, the
      <i>more</i> tag creates a pop-up window containing these characters, which you can
      then cut &amp; paste.
  <li>or you can type the Apple Opt- shortcut codes for these characters.
      <br>(They're a lot faster than using cut &amp; paste,
          once you get used to the codes.)
      <br>You hold the Opt key and type the accent symbol, then type the letter to be accented
          (or, for some codes, only hold the Opt key and type the symbol).
      <br>(This is for the US-English keyboard layout. It may not work for other keyboards.)
      <br>The table below shows the codes we use.
          (<a href="charapp.pdf">Print-friendly version of this table)</a>

      <br>Don't use other special characters unless the Project Manager tells you to in
          the <a href="#comments">Project Comments</a>.
  </li>

<h3><a name="f_chars">Non-English Characters</a> </h3>
<p>For text printed in non-english characters; that is, characters other than the Latin
    A...Z characters, for example <b>Greek</b>, <b>Cyrillic</b> (used in Russian &amp;
    other Slavic languages), <b>Hebrew</b>, or <b>Arabic</b> characters, there are two
    ways to deal with these. </p>

<p> The simplest way is just to mark it, and leave it for the post-proofer to deal with.
    To do this, just surround the text with <tt>[Greek: **]</tt>, <tt>[Cyrillic:
    **]</tt>, <tt>[Hebrew: **]</tt>, or <tt>[Arabic: **]</tt> and leave it as scanned.
    Include the <tt>**</tt> so the post-proofer can deal with it later. </p>
<p> The second method is more work, but provides a more accurate text.  This involves
    converting each character of the foreign text into the equivalent ASCII Latin
    letter(s).  This mainly means looking up each character in the tables listed below,
    and substituting them. </p>

<ul compact>
  <li> Greek:
       <a href="http://www.gutenberg.net/vol/greek.html">Greek to ASCII Primer</a> (from
       Project Gutenberg)
  </li>
  <li> Cyrillic:
       <a href="http://www.history.uiuc.edu/steinb/translit/translit.htm">Transliteration Table</a>
  </li>
  <li> Hebrew:
       Not recommended unless you are fluent in Hebrew.  There are significant
       difficulties in Hebrew-to-ASCII transliteration (right-to-left reading order,
       vowels typically omitted in writing, different pronunciation schemes by region,
       etc.) and neither <a href="http://texts01.archive.org/dp/">Distributed
       Proofreaders</a> nor <a href="http://www.gutenberg.net/">Project Gutenberg</a>

       has yet chosen a standard method.  Join the Forum discussion on this if you are
       interested.
  </li>
  <li> Arabic:
       Not recommended unless you are fluent in Arabic.  Like Hebrew, there are
       significant difficulties in Arabic-to-ASCII transliteration and neither <a
       href="http://texts01.archive.org/dp/">Distributed Proofreaders</a> nor <a
       href="http://www.gutenberg.net/">Project Gutenberg</a> has yet chosen a
       standard method.

<h3><a name="fract_s">Fractions</a> </h3>

<p> For <b>fractions</b>, convert them like this: <tt>2&frac12;</tt> becomes
    <tt>2-1/2</tt>.</p>

<h3><a name="page_ref">Page References</a> </h3>
<p> Some non-fiction works will reference themselves by giving a page number to go to,
    for example: (see p. 123). Please leave these references that are within the text
    (even though we remove page numbers from the Table of Contents &amp; Index pages).
    Do not mark these with a <tt>*</tt> either, unless the Project Manager specifies
    this in the <a href="#comments">Project Comments</a>. </p>

<h3><a name="bk_index">Indexes</a> </h3>
<p> Remove all page numbers from index pages, along with any ... or *** used to align
    the page numbers.  You can leave any trailing commas or semicolons.
    (When the book is converted to electronic form, there will no longer be any 'pages'
    in the book, so page numbers are not useful.  Some Project Managers prefer to
    remove the index pages entirely because of this -- if so, they will tell you this in
    the <a href="#comments">Project Comments</a>.  Other PM's leave index pages, as they
    are an indication of what the author thought important enough to list.  Include
    index pages unless told otherwise.)</p>
<p>
    For sub-topic listings in an index, start each one on a new line, indented 2 spaces.
    For example:                <br>
      <tt>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;Hooker, Jos., maj. gen. U. S. V.,                                 <br>

        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;assigned to command Porter's corps;                   <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;afterwards, McDowell's;                               <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;in pursuit of Lee;                                    <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;at South Mt.;                                         <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;unacceptable to Halleck, retires from active service. <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;Hopkins, Henry H.,                                                <br>

        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;notorious secessionist in Kanawha valley;             <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;controversy with Gen. Cox over escaped slave.         <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;Hosea, Lewis M.,                                                  <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;capt. on Gen. Wilson's staff,                         <br>
      </tt>
</p>
<p>
    Old books sometimes printed the first word of each letter in the index in all caps;
    change this to a normal word (first letter only capitalized), unless it's <a
    href="#bold">bold text</a>.</p>

<h3><a name="trail_s">Trailing Space at End-of-line</a> </h3>
<p> Don't bother putting spaces at the ends of
    lines of text. Waste of your time for something that we can take care of
    automatically later. Similarly don't waste time taking out extra spaces at the ends
    of lines.</p>

<h3><a name="play_n">Play Actor Names/Stage Notes</a> </h3>
<p>Mark all actor names in italics if they are <a href="#italics">Italics</a> in the
    original text, mark them as bold if they are <a href="#bold">Bold</a> in the
    original text.  And Stage Notes too: format them like they are in the original text.
    </p>

<h3><a name="anything">Anything else that needs special handling</a> </h3>
<p>If you run into something that isn't covered in these guidelines that you think needs
   special handling, put an asterisk (<tt>*</tt>) next to it in your proofed text.  (You
   can also put a note there explaining the problem.) This signals the post-proofer to
   stop and examine this text &amp; the matching image, and deal with it. This does slow
   down the post-proof processing of this text, so don't do this unless you are sure
   that it is needed.

<h2>Common Problems</h2>

<h3><a name="OCR_1lI">1-l-I OCR Problems </a> </h3>
<p> OCR scanners commonly have trouble distinguishing between the digit one (1), the
    lowercase letter l, and the uppercase letter I.  This is especially true for some of
    our older books where the pages may be in poor condition. Watch out for these.  Read
    the context of the sentence to determine which is the correct character, but be
    careful--often your mind will automatically 'correct' these when you are reading.
    </p>

<h3><a name="OCR_other">Other OCR Problems </a> </h3>

<p> OCR scanners often have trouble with dashes &amp; hyphens, so watch for these.  The
    rule is to use one hyphen (minus sign) for a <a
    href="#eol_hyphen">hyphenated-word</a>; use 2 hyphens for a longer <a
    href="#em-dashes">dash (Em-dash)</a>.  And no spaces around either one. OCR'd text
    often has only one hyphen for a dash that should have 2. </p>

<p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  [...more to be added...] </p>

<h3><a name="hand_notes">Handwritten Notes in Book</a> </h3>
<p> Do not include handwritten notes in a book, unless it is impossible to read the text
    that the handwritten note is replacing.</p>

<h3><a name="bad_image">Bad Images</a> </h3>
<p> If an image is bad (not loading, chopped off, unable to be read), please put a post
    about this bad image in the project comments <a href="#forums">forum</a>.  Do not
    click on "Quit without Saving"; if you do, the next person will get that page. Click
    on your back button to the project listing page or go back to
    http://texts01.archive.org/dp/tools/proofers/proof_per.php until we create a better
    method in the coming weeks.</p>
<p> It's fairly common for the image to be good, but the OCR scan is missing the first
    line or two of the text.  Please just type in the missing line(s).  If nearly all of
    the lines are missing in the scan, then either type in the whole page (if you are
    willing to do that), or just click on the "Quit without Saving" button and the page
    will be reissued to someone else.  If there are several pages like this, you might
    post a note in the project comments <a href="#forums">forum</a> to notify the
    Project Manager. </p>

<h3><a name="bad_text">Wrong Image for Text</a> </h3>
<p> If there is a wrong image for the text given, please put a post about this bad image
    in the project comments <a href="#forums">forum</a>.  Do not click on "Quit without
    Saving"; if you do, the next person will get that page.  Click on your back button
    to the project listing page or go back to
    http://texts01.archive.org/dp/tools/proofers/proof_per.php until we create a better
    method in the coming weeks.</p>

<h3><a name="round1">Previous Proofreader Mistakes</a> </h3>
<p> If the previous proofreader made a lot of mistakes or missed a lot of things, you
    can send them a message by clicking on their name. That will allow you to send them
    a private forum message. <em>Please be nice!</em> These are people volunteering
    their help, usually trying their best.  The point of the message should be to inform
    them of the correct way to do proofing, rather than criticize them as incompetent,
    careless, etc. <br> (If the previous proofreader did an outstanding job, you can
    also send them a message about that.) </p>

<h3><a name="p_errors">Printer Errors/Misspellings</a> </h3>
<p> Due to printer errors, there can be some misspellings. If you believe these to be
    true printer errors, then you should fix them. Some may be due to differences in
    spelling of words from a long time ago. Do not try to correct those to modern
    English.</p>

<h3><a name="f_errors">Factual Errors in Texts</a> </h3>
<p> In general, don't correct factual errors in the author's book.  Many of the books we
    are proofing have statements of fact in them that we no longer accept as accurate.
    Leave them as the author wrote them. </p>
<p> A possible exception is in technical or scientific books, where a known formula or
    equation may be given incorrectly.  (Especially if it is shown correctly on other
    pages of the book.) Notify the Project Manager about these, either by sending them a
    message via the <a href="#forums">Forum</a>, or by inserting <tt>[sic*
    explain-your-concern]</tt> at that point in the text. </p>
