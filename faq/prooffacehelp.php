<h2>Introduction</h2>

<p>
To understand the interface,
you need to understand the following Q &amp; A.

<p>
<b>Q</b>:
Where do my pages go?

<p>
<b>A</b>:
There are four possible destinations in the system
for the pages that you proofread.
They are:

<ul>
    <li>
    <b><a name=done>"DONE"</a></b>:
    All final changes are saved, and proofreading is completed.
    These pages are ready to go to the next round.
    There are links to the five most recent pages in this category
    on the Project Comments page, under the heading "DONE".
    These pages can be re-opened for corrections if necessary
    by clicking on the individual links.
    Do not mark a page "DONE" unless you have really finished correcting it,
    or else this partially-proofread page may move to the next round
    when the rest of the project does!
    </li>

    <li>
    <b><a name=progr>"IN PROGRESS"</a></b>:
    Changes made so far are saved, but proofreading is not yet completed.
    These pages are not yet ready to go the next round.
    There are links to the five most recent pages in this category
    on the Project Comments page, under the heading "IN PROGRESS".
    These pages are waiting for you to complete them;
    you can do so by clicking on the individual links
    to re-open them and finish the proofreading.
    If you do not complete them,
    eventually the system will reclaim them for someone else to proofread.
    </li>

    <li>
    <b><a name=return>"RETURN TO ROUND"</a></b>
    All changes are abandoned,
    original version of page made available for someone else to proofread.
    This is for pages that, once you saw them,
    you decided you didn't want to or couldn't proofread,
    but that someone else might be able to.
    Whoever next clicks on the "Start Proofreading" link for this project
    will get the page to proofread.
    </li>

    <li>
    <b><a name=bad>"BAD"</a></b>
    All changes are abandoned, page cannot be proofread due to damage or flaws
    and is made unavailable until it can be repaired by the Project Manager.
    </li>

</ul>

<p>
When you open a page for proofreading,
it is automatically <a href="#progr">"IN PROGRESS"</a>
</p>

<p>
Now you will understand the following explanations of what the buttons do.
</p>

<hr>

<?php

// -----------------------------------------------------------------------------

$help = Array();

$help["Save as 'Done'"] = "
<p>
    <i>\"I have finished proofreading this page,
    it is as correct as I can make it,
    so I want to save it as <a href='#done'>DONE</a>,
    and stop proofreading for now.\"</i>
</p>
<p>
    Save all changes, and finish proofreading the current page.
    The page is now <a href='#done'>DONE</a>.
    Stop proofreading.
    The proofreading browser window will close.
</p>
";

$help["Save as 'Done' & Proofread Next Page"] = "
<p>
    <i>\"I have finished proofreading this page,
    it is as correct as I can make it,
    so I want to save it as <a href='#done'>DONE</a>,
    and start proofreading the next available page.\"</i>
</p>
<p>
    Save all changes, and finish proofreading the current page.
    The page is now <a href='#done'>DONE</a>.
    The next available page within the project, if any,
    will be opened for proofreading.
</p>
";

$help["Save as 'In Progress'"] = "
<p>
    <i>\"I haven't finished proofreading this page,
    but I want to save my work on it so far.\"</i>
</p>
<p>
    Save changes to the current page.
    The page is now <a href='#progr'>IN PROGRESS</a>.
    This button is intended to temporarily save your work so far
    on a page you plan to finish later,
    perhaps because it is too long or you are interrupted.
    You will be repositioned to the start of the page.
</p>
";

$help['Stop Proofreading'] = "
<p>
    <i>\"I haven't finished proofreading this page,
    but I want to stop proofreading for now.
    I will finish proofreading this page later.\"</i>
</p>
<p>
    Closes the proofreading interface without saving the current page.
    The page will be <a href='#progr'>IN PROGRESS</a>.
    To save your most recent changes before quitting,
    use the \"Save as 'In Progress'\" button first.
    Note that \"Save as 'In Progress'\" followed by 'Stop Proofreading'
    (page is left <a href='#progr'>IN PROGRESS</a>)
    is NOT equivalent to \"Save as 'Done'\"
    (page is left <a href='#done'>DONE</a>).
</p>
";

$help['Report Bad Page'] = "
<p>
    <i>\"This page is damaged or flawed so badly no one could proofread it.\"</i>
</p>
<p>
    Loads the Report Bad Page form.
</p>
<p>
    Rarely, some damaged pages cannot be proofread.
    For instance, the image may be incomplete or unreadable,
    or the OCR text may be from a different image.
    In these cases, where some repairs have to be made to the files
    by the Project Manager,
    the page can be marked 'Bad' and removed from proofreading until fixed.
    Further information
    (including how to tell a truly bad page from a false alarm)
    is available on the Report Bad Page form itself.
    If you press the 'Submit Report' button on the Bad Page Report form,
    the page is now <a href='#bad'>BAD</a>;
    if you press the 'Cancel' button instead,
    the page is <a href='#progr'>IN PROGRESS</a>.
</p>
";


$help['Show All Text'] = "
<p>
    Clicking this button opens up a new browser window and displays
    the proofread text as it would appear on an HTML-formatted page
    complete with italics, bolding, etc.
</p>
<p>
    Although this function is helpful to people working in the
    formatting rounds, it also helps proofreaders because it
    displays the text in a different font and slightly different format.
    Sometimes that's all it takes for a sneaky scanning error (scanno)
    to suddenly jump off the page at you!
</p>
";


$help['Preview'] = "
<p>
    Clicking this button displays the proofread text in a manner
    that allows the proofreader or formatter to control whether
    or how the various tags display and whether the text is
    wrapped or not.
</p>
<p>
    This feature is especially valuable to formatters but can
    also assist proofreaders in locating errors. Text cannot
    be edited in this frame. To return to the regular editing
    frame, click on the \"Quit\" button.
</p>
";


$help['Return Page to Round'] =
$help['Return Page to Current Round'] = "
<p>
    <i>\"This page is more than I can (or want to) proofread at the moment,
    but someone else may have better luck.\"</i>
</p>
<p>
    Abandons any changes you have made to the current page,
    and returns the original version
    to the top of the pile of available pages for this project,
    waiting for the next proofreader
    who requests a new page to proofread from this project,
    to whom it will go for proofreading.
    (See <a href='#return'>RETURN TO ROUND</a>.)
</p>
<p>
    If a page seems too long or complex for you,
    you can return it to round for someone else to do.
    (Note if you then immediately request a new page to proofread,
    the 'someone else' may be you!
    If you don't want to go proofread a different project instead,
    you can \"Save as 'In Progress'\" the page, 'Stop Proofreading' and follow the 'Start Proofreading' link.
    This will load the next available page,
    leaving the one you wanted to skip in your 'IN PROGRESS' section.
    When you have finished proofreading for the day,
    you can re-open it from there and press 'Return Page to Round'
    to immediately make it available for someone else to proofread.)
</p>
";

$help['WordCheck'] =
$help['Run WordCheck'] = "
<p>
    <i>\"I want to check this page with the automatic word checker.\"</i>
</p>
<p>
    Loads the WordCheck form.
    The text is checked for possible problems (misspelled words, scannos, etc).
    Problem words are presented as text boxes for possible correction.

    See also the <a href=\"wordcheck-faq.php\">WordCheck FAQ</a>.
</p>
<p>
    When done, the corrections made can be submitted (applied) or cancelled.
</p>
<p>
    In either case the page is <a href='#progr'>IN PROGRESS</a>.
</p>
";

$help['Switch to Vertical/Horizontal'] = "
<p>

<p>
    Toggles your interface layout between
    vertical mode
    (scanned image of page appears to the LEFT of the OCR text you are correcting)
    and
    horizontal mode
    (scanned image of page appears ABOVE the OCR text you are correcting).
    On the way, it performs a 'SAVE'.
    The page is <a href='#progr'>IN PROGRESS</a>.

$help['Check for Common Errors'] = "
<p>
    Interactively searches the current text for common errors.
<p>
    To <b>start</b> the error checking sequence,
    click the Check for Common Errors Button.
    The error check messages will replace the text in the text editing area.
<p>
    To <b>stop</b> the error checking sequence,
    click the Undo Revert button
    to restore to the last edit before starting the common errors check.
    Any changes made during the check will be lost.
<p>
    To <b>continue</b> the error checking process
    after any prompt message in the text editing area,
    click the Check for Common Errors button.
<p>
    If an error is found, the discovery of the error and type of error
    will be displayed in the text editing area.
    Click the check for common errors button to show the location of the error.
    The error will be located at the end of the text editing area and,
    depending upon the location of the error in the text,
    may require you to scroll to end of the text editing area
    to see the potential error.
    Once you have fixed the error or determined that it is not an error,
    click the Check for Common Errors button
    to continue the error checking sequence.
<p>
    When the error checking sequence is complete,
    click the Check for Common Errors button
    to replace the error check messages with the text.
    Changes made during the error checking process will be included in the text.
    If you wish to undo any changes made during the process,
    click the Undo Revert button
    to restore to your last edit before starting
    the Check for Common Errors sequence.
<p>
    The Check for Common Errors sequence
    <em>does not</em> replace the need for manual proofreading.

    This shows the index number
    of the files on our site that contain the information
    (scanned image and OCR text)
    for the page in the book you are proofreading.
    It may vary from the printed page number of the book,
    since some of the pages that get scanned
    (such as introduction pages, some illustration pages)
    have no ordinary page numbers in the book,
    but still count as another page to be proofread on the site.
    Also some books have numbered pages that are otherwise blank,
    and sometimes these are not scanned,
    further throwing out the correspondence
    between the 'on site' page number and the 'printed' page number.
    If the OCR text matches the text in the image,
    then this is not a case of 'mismatched image/text',
    even if the page that was scanned
    was numbered, say, 10 in the book and

<h2>Help for Proofreading Toolbox</h2>
</a>


<h3>Special Character Selection</h3>

<p>
Most keyboards do not have enough keys to cover all characters needed in some
of our projects. Depending on your Operating System, you may be able to use
alternate methods to insert the special characters directly (see the
Proofreading Guidelines for suggestions).
</p>

<p>
As an alternate option, the Proofreading interfaces have a tiled character
picker. At the top of the picker is a row of menu tiles. Hovering over a menu
tile will show a tooltip containing a short description of what characters
that menu contains. Clicking a menu tile will show a grid of characters below
it. Hovering over a character will show an enlarged view of it in the box on
the left and a tooltip text will appear describing the character. Clicking
on a character will insert it into the text.
</p>


<h3 id="srchrep">Search/Replace Popup</h3>

<p>
    This tool makes it easier to make repetitive changes.
    Click on the Search/Replace button and a small window pops up,
    containing a search value and a replace value.
</p>
<p>
    Clicking <input type='button' value='Replace all'> will replace all
    matched instances of the search text with the value from the replace text.
    You may undo this change by clicking <input type='button' value='Undo'>, but only
    the most recent replace operation may be reverted.
</p>
<p>
    For more complex search matching, regular expressions may be used.
    <blockquote>
        . &mdash; any character, excluding new line characters<br>
        [a-z0-9] &mdash; lowercase letters and numbers<br>
        a{4} &mdash; four lowercase As<br>
        [Aa]{6} &mdash; six As of either case<br>
        A{2,8} &mdash; between 2 and 8 capital As<br>
        [hb]e &mdash; 'he' or 'be'<br>
    </blockquote>
</p>
<p>
    To replace matched text with a new line, \n may be used in the replace field.
</p>


<h3>Greek transliteration popup</h3>

<p>
    The most common non-Latin alphabet we encounter is Greek.
    We usually wish to transliterate Greek letters into Latin ones,
    and wrap the result in tags [Greek: ].
    So
    <blockquote>
    &beta;&iota;&beta;&lambda;&omicron;&sigmaf;
    </blockquote>
    in the image is rendered
    <pre>
    [Greek: biblos]
    </pre>
    in our proofread page.
</p>
<p>
    To make it easier to select the correct transliterated characters,
    this tool has been provided.
    Click on the Greek button and a small window pops up,
    containing upper and lower case Greek alphabets and a text box.
</p>
<p>
    All of the Greek letters in the popup box are clickable.
    Click the ones that appear in the Greek word in the image,
    and the Latin transliterations appear in the text box,
    from whence they can be cut-and-pasted into the proofread text
    and surrounded with [Greek: ] tags.
</p>
<p>
    For more information please see the Proofreading Guidelines.

<h3>Common Tags</h3>

<p>
You may sometimes find formatting already present in the text.
Do not add or correct this formatting information; the formatters
will do that later in the process. However, you can remove it if
it interferes with your proofreading. The <s>&lt;x&gt;</s> button in the
proofreading interface will remove markup such as &lt;i&gt; and &lt;b&gt;
from highlighted text. Here are common tags that you may see
on a page you are proofreading. Proofreaders should not add tags
since that is done in the formatting rounds.
<p>

    &lt;i&gt;,
    &lt;/i&gt; (<i>italic</i> text),
    &lt;b&gt;,
    &lt;/b&gt; (<b>bold</b> text),
    &lt;sc&gt;,
    &lt;/sc&gt; (<span style='font-variant: small-caps'>Small Caps</span> text),
    Sidenote,
    Illustration,
    *,
    [&nbsp;],
    Footnote,
    /*,
    */ (poetry),
    /#,
    #/ (blockquote),
    *&nbsp;*&nbsp;*&nbsp;*&nbsp;* (thought break),
    Blank Page
</p>

<p>
    Along the lower line of the proofreading toolbox
    in the lower pane of the proofreading interface
    are controls labelled with the common tags listed above.
    You can use these buttons to place tags into the proofreading text area.
    If you select text before you click on a button in the toolbox, the text will be
    surrounded by the respective tag.
</p>
<p>
    The tags will also appear in the text boxes to the left of the Italic button. You 
    can also copy and paste the tags from the text box if the select and surround feature does not
    work in your browser.
    These features are provided as a convenience;
    if you'd really rather type the tags in by hand you are welcome to.
</p>
<p>
    For example, if the caption for an illustration is in your page,
    you can select the caption in the text box
    (by clicking your mouse at the start of the caption,
    and dragging the mouse to the end of the caption
    while keeping the button depressed),
    then click on the "Illustration" link in the proofreading toolbox,
    to have the desired tags inserted at the beginning and end of the caption.
</p>
<p>
    In cases where a common tag is singular
    (such as the 'thought break' row of asterisks),
    you can select, say, a space character in the text
    where you want the tag to be added,
    and it will be positioned there when you click the tag link.
</p>
<p>
    Note that [Blank Page] will clear any existing text in the proofreading window.
</p>

<h4>Shortcuts to insert common tags</h4>
<p>
    These shortcuts may not work for everyone, and the Alt may be a different key
    combination depending on your Operating System and browser.
