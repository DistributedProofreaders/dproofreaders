DP FAQ Formatting Guide

version 0.11 by Bill Keir

18 Sept 2003


NB:       READ, OPEN AND SAVE 
             THIS FILE AS 
              ***TEXT***
             NOT AS HTML!

View it in a text editor, not a web
browser or fancy word processor. It discusses
HTML tags and uses examples of them and 
we want you to be able to see them as they
really are. :) 

For full effect, do NOT rewrap this text 
file, leave line wrap OFF, and scroll 
sideways when you have to, as necessary. This 
suggestion is not a whim, but has a point
that will hopefully become clear before
you have read it all. :D




Just as we have guidelines on proofreading a page
or post-processing a project at DP, describing
what to do and how the finished product should 
look, so we now are creating guidelines on
writing a FAQ for use on DP.  

This initial version covers 


Internal Formatting 

The Impact of PHP

and

The Impact of CVS



=====================
=INTERNAL FORMATTING=
=====================



Our FAQ files will be viewed in several 
different types of programs for several 
different purposes. These different 
types of programs have different ways 
of dealing with the contents of the file. 
Ideally we will be able to set 
the files up so that they work well with 
all the different programs at once.

The different types of program include:


Web browsers
============

So users can read the FAQ - this is of 
course the main purpose of the file! 


Text editors
============

So you and I and other people (if we are 
hit by buses, or if there is a small typo 
found that could be corrected by anybody, 
etc) can edit, maintain and improve the 
file over time. (HTML editors are a 
variation of this, but almost always 
contain a web browser and a text editor 
combined. You get the preview of the web 
page in the web browser part, and can 
edit the HTML code directly in the text 
editor part. Sometimes you can also edit inside 
the 'browser' part, but you don't NEED to.)


"CVS"
=====

Our code version control system, so the site 
developers can keep track of what changes 
were made to the file when and by who, and, 
if necessary, obtain any particular version 
of it, either current or historical. This
allows the co-ordination and management of 
many different people working on many different
documents, which means the workload need
not settle on a few.




The main way these programs differ in how 
they deal with a FAQ file is that Web browsers 
will read it only in terms of the HTML code 
inside it. In HTML whitespace is largely 
ignored. ("Whitespace" includes spaces, tabs, 
end-of-line characters and similar 'non-visible' 
characters.) A web browser pays attention to 
*A* space between words, but it does not 
distinguish between one space and, say, seven 
spaces; it does not distinguish between end-of-line 
characters, spaces, tabs or other whitespace at all 
(unless they are enclosed in the "preformatted 
text" tags <pre> and </pre>), counting all of
these as equivalent to a single space. 

So, the following are equivalent to a web browser:

<p>This is       
                      a         sentence with
lots


of			  white 




    space in my text 
editor</p>

and

<p>This is a sentence with lots of white space 
in my text editor</p>

Both will show up on the web page as the same 
paragraph, though they look very different 
while reading the html as text (like you do 
in a text editor).

Text editors (and CVS), on the other hand,
WILL pay close attention to whitespace. In fact 
CVS goes a step further, and sees the whole 
file as a collection of individual lines. 
Given that the file will show up the 
same way in the web browser if all we change 
is whitespace (outside of any <pre> </pre> tags), 
we are free to add whitespace to make it 
convenient for both text editors and CVS 
to work with the file, without affecting the
presentation of the final product at all.




Here is a section of a FAQ formatted as text in three 
different ways. Although all three look very different
in a text editor, all three will render exactly the
same way inside a web browser.

Comments
--------

This sample has had white space removed. This makes
it bad for text editors even if line wrap is "on" (an 
option in many text editors to artificially wrap the 
text to the width of the window, only). If line wrap
is off, it's worse. If you are reading this
file in a text editor, switch line wrap off if you
can. This sample text which will appear in a 
web browser as several paragraphs can be seen above
formatted as three very, very long lines (or perhaps 
only one, even longer, depending on your text editor). 
It makes no difference to the web browser, but makes it
difficult to see where you are or to find a particular
spot when editing in a text editor.

Comments
--------

This sample has lots of useful whitespace - useful 
to a text editor, that is, as the web browser will
render it exactly the same as it does sample 1! 
However, for a human being editing this text in a 
text editor (with line wrap switched on), this is MUCH 
easier. The individual paragraphs and list items are
separated, it's much easier to find a particular spot
and see 'where you are' at all times. 

However if you switch line wrap off you will see that
the individual paragraphs are presented as single lines;
there is no 'hard return' or end-of-line character 
to force an end-of-line within a paragraph. The paragraph
starting "The purpose of post-processing..." is over 600
characters long, and the one after that over 450.

If the person editing the file had to work in a 
text editor that did NOT have a line wrap mode, 
lines of this length would make it awkward to do so. 
If the page threshold for PPing changes from 400 
to 500 pages, there'd be much scrolling back and 
forth sideways to locate the correct part of the text.

Such long lines are what makes this format
bad for CVS. CVS has no 'line wrap' mode,
it sees the file purely as a collection of lines, each
ended by a hard-return end-of-line character. One
of the most useful functions of CVS is to show
the differences between different versions of
a file. It does this by reporting each line
that has changed. If 400 had been changed to 500
in the example above, and a report on the differences
between the before and after version was requested
by someone else, it would report the whole 450
character one-line paragraph as having been changed.

As a further example, how easy is it to spot the change
made between the first and second copy of this? (For
best simulation of the situation facing the developer 
using CVS, make sure your line wrap is OFF before you 
try to find the change in the two following lines)

<p>The purpose of post-processing is to massage an etext into a readable form.  In its journey through two proofreading rounds, the text will have been edited by perhaps hundreds of proofers.  The post-processor must standardize the formatting of the book and adjust it to comply with Project's Gutenberg's requirements.

The ultimate goal of post-processing is to create a plain-text etext with consistent formatting throughout, which contains as few errors as possible, and which accurately reflects the intentions of the author.</p>

Just as we added whitespace to Sample 1 and 
made it friendly to text editors as well as
web browsers, so we can add a little more whitespace
to Sample 2 and make it friendly to CVS as well
as text editors and web browsers. Thus, 
Sample 3...

Comments

This maybe doesn't look quite as nice, especially 
if you are viewing it in a text editor with
line wrap on and a window too narrow. Turn line wrap
OFF and make the window as wide as possible. The paragraphs
may look a little weird in the text editor, but they are
not THAT different: the only real changes between samples 
2 and 3 are 

1. 

No line goes for more than about 80 characters 
without a hard-return end-of-line character.

and 

2. 

<p> and </p> tags get a line of their own


To a web browser, though, this Sample will show 
up exactly the same as Samples 1 or 2. The separate 
lines in each paragraph will flow together just as 
nicely as if the extra whitespace wasn't there - 
from a web browser's perspective, it's all just single 
spaces! And it's in a web browser that the readers 
will be reading the FAQ, after all.


The reasons for these changes:
==============================


1. Limit on line length
-----------------------

This is what makes this format so friendly 
for CVS. When asked to report the differences 
between versions when the same change was 
made as in the second example above, 
it will show:



and adjust it to comply with Project's Gutenberg's requirements. 

and adjust it to comply with Project Gutenberg's requirements. 



Rather easier to spot exactly what is different 
between the two versions now! Each line is tracked
separately by CVS, and making the lines bite-size
in terms of processing by the human brain is
a great improvement.

When a whole sentence fits under 80 characters, 
that's a great natural candidate for a line by itself.
The question is, where do you break lines that
are over 80 characters long? There is no exact 
science, but after a ; or a , or lacking them,
after the end of some grammatical component of
a sentence, all make good candidates for forcing 
a line break. Have a look at how it was done in 
Sample 3 above and you will see samples of most
of these.

One way to look at this is to imagine
you are preparing an etext to be read on a screen
that is under 80 characters wide. Soft wrap does 
not count, each line must have been ended by having
had the ENTER key explicitly pressed. To see
the text as CVS will see it, turn line wrap OFF,
and edit the file that way.


2. <p> and </p> tags get a line of their own
--------------------------------------------

This is a minor point, but it means that if 
lines are added to the start or end of 
a paragraph later, only the new text itself will
be reported as a change; it won't look like
a new paragraph was created (unless one was).
It's perhaps really only worth the effort if the 
paragraph extends over more than one line.



If you want to put MORE whitespace in, to make it 
easier for you to organise the FAQ and see the 
different sections, feel free. The key to
making it CVS-friendly is keeping the length
of the lines down. 






===================
=THE IMPACT OF PHP=
===================

In the good old days, our FAQs were 100% 
written in HTML. All that showed up on the 
screen in the web browser was the rendering 
of the HTML code you typed in. Now we have 
moved to PHP, which sounds like it might be 
a big change, but really only means now our FAQs 
are 99.9% written in HTML, and some things 
show up on the screen in the web browser that
you might think you didn't put there.

To quote Michael Dyck:

"(1) With .html documents, the file that reaches the
browser is pretty much the same as the file sitting on
the server. So if you View Source or Save Page in your
browser, you'll get something pretty close to what's on
the server. But this is not true with .php files. So if
you want to change something, you should start with an
(up-to-date) copy of the .php file on the server, and
not a 'Save' of the document that reaches your browser.

"(2) If you don't understand the stuff between the <? ?>
marks, that's okay, just leave it alone. (One problem
here is that if you view a .php file in an HTML
browser, links like
    <a href="<? echo $projects_forum_url ?>">foo</a>
aren't going to work.) If you add something (usually a
URL) that would be better expressed as a <??>, a more
PHP-knowledgeable person can take care of rephrasing
it."


<a href="<? echo $projects_forum_url ?>">  
is what we use for the project forums URL, instead
of something like <a href="http://www.pgdp.net/phpBB2/viewforum.php?f=2">.
This anchor will never need changing, even if the site 
moves and the forums are renamed or moved, you can always 
just cut-n-paste this string for the project 
forums URL and it will work. It will work 
whether or not you are 100% sure why, so 
don't worry if it seems a little mysterious.

Similar PHP forum URL substitutions exist for
the General Forum and the PP Forum.

$general_forum_url         = "$forums_url/viewforum.php?f=1";
$projects_forum_url        = "$forums_url/viewforum.php?f=2";
$post_processing_forum_url = "$forums_url/viewforum.php?f=3";

If you want to add URLs to posts or forums, you
can  add them in either form, and I can change
them if necessary before committing the file 
to CVS (a necessary prelude to rolling it out
on site). When you are making changes or 
creating later versions of the FAQ, though,
please do not change any of the <? echo $blah ?>
style links back to the http://www.pgdp.net/phpbb2/ 
style, as I will then only have to change them 
back again to php style myself before the FAQ
can be rolled out. It's only for on site urls 
that point to a directory other than the FAQ 
directory that will need this treatment, by the
way. URLs to completely different sites can
and should remain as is, and also links to
other files in the FAQ directory can remain
the same (these are links that just feature
a file name, like document.php for the Proofreading
Guidelines).


One of the things PHP has done for us in FAQs 
is allow all of them to appear with the
standard site header. This is done by starting
the FAQ file with a snippet of PHP code like:

<?
$relPath='../pinc/';
include($relPath.'v_site.inc');
include($relPath.'connect.inc');
include($relPath.'theme.inc');
new dbConnect();
$no_stats=1;
theme('Post-Processing FAQ','header');
?>


The only thing that should be changed in
here is the title of the document in the
line that starts 'theme'.

This is what Michael was talking about above,
that the file on the server (which contains
just that little snippet of PHP code) can
look different from the file sent to the web
browser. That little snippet of PHP is executed
when the page is loaded from the server by 
a web browser, and sends, not itself, but 
instead the following HTML, to the browser:


(NB The details of this lump of code, following,
 are not important; it's just the definition 
of our standard header. The point is that although
this HTML code shows up in the web browser,
it is not actually in the FAQ file)

This is the HTML that defines our standard site header.
There are links in it to the forums, and FAQ central, and your inbox, etc. 
But someone who has selected a different theme will see a 
slightly different version, with different colours. PHP
produces customised HTML code on the fly, which is why
we can start our FAQs with

<?
$relPath='../pinc/';
include($relPath.'v_site.inc');
include($relPath.'connect.inc');
include($relPath.'theme.inc');
new dbConnect();
$no_stats=1;

?>

and have them show up in the browsers as if all
the above huge lump of HTML code was in there 
at the start, but personalised for each user's taste 
in colours and styles.

This is why grabbing the version of the FAQ file
out of your browser (by saving it as HTML, for 
instance) will NOT produce the desired result: 
a copy of the file that can be edited to
produce an updated version of the FAQ.

This ties in with CVS, which brings us to:




===================
=THE IMPACT OF CVS=
===================


CVS owns the master copies of all the code,
and all the files on site. This includes
the FAQs. The one true copy is the one in CVS.
(Actually, there are many copies in CVS, one
for each different committed version of
each file. Whichever one is on the live site
is also in CVS, but it is CVS's copy of that
current version that is the "one true master copy"
from which all others are derived.)

This system allows everyone to get to the
"one true master copies", directly or indirectly,
at any time.

A file being in CVS means many people can make
many small changes or corrections, and they are
all included in the latest copy. Whether you are
going to produce a major upgrade or merely fix a
single typo, it is from a copy of the one true
master copy in CVS that you should/must start.
Any FAQ maintainers who do not have (or want?)
direct CVS access can ask anyone who does to
send them the latest copy of a file to start work
on. If the changes are small (on the level of a typo
or a few lines, or even "add this paragraph here"),
then you can email the description and content of 
the changes to me and I will make them for you.
