# 3rd Party Code

This directory contains 3rd party code -- that is other open source code that
the DP code relies on for various functionality.

When adding files to this directory, you must ensure that the software's
license allows it to be included. Include a copy of the license in the
directory as well as a `README.md` file describing what it is, where it came
from, and how to update it.

You must also include a `details.json` file that includes meta information
about the software. This is used on the open source attributions page to
ensure we are meeting our legal requirements for attribution-required
licenses.
