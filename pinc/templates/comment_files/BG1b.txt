<p><b>BASIC INSTRUCTIONS:</b></p>
<p><b>Here are a few basic instructions.</b> Please consult the <a href="http://www.pgdp.net/c/faq/proofreading_guidelines.php">Proofreading
Guidelines</a> to go beyond these basics. </p>

<p><b>Make the text look like the page image except as per below!</b> That means leaving in the breaks at the ends of the lines, leaving spelling "mistakes", etc. Mostly your job is to fix mistakes left by the Optical Character Recognition (OCR) software. Compare the text carefully to the scanned image of the page, line by line (or word by word, or letter by letter). Please pay extra-close attention to punctuation, numbers, and words in ALL CAPS. It's a good idea to run WordCheck on your page, and make sure that any queried words and the highlighted punctuation do, in fact, match the words and punctuation in the scan. Please do NOT change the word in the text if it is a true match to the word in the scan. Refer to the <a
href="http://www.pgdp.net/c/faq/proofreading_guidelines.php#p_errors">Proofreading
Guidelines</a> for more information on handling printers' errors and misspellings. </p>

<ol><li><p>Page Headers and Footers: Running headers/footers may include book title, author, chapter title, and/or page number. They will be at the <b>very top or bottom</b> of the page. Remove these, including the page numbers and any extra blank lines. See the <a
href="http://www.pgdp.net/c/faq/proofreading_guidelines.php#page_hf">Proofreading
Guidelines</a> for an example.

<li><p>If a line ends in a hyphenated word, move the first part of the following line up to rejoin the word, then insert a line break at the end of the rejoined word. Remove the hyphen unless it is a compound word normally hyphenated. If you're not sure if the hyphen should be retained, or if the page ends with a hyphen, keep the hyphen and place an asterisk after it.</p>

<p><i>Original Image:</i>
<br>"I say, Graham, do you know what's hap-
<br>pened? There'll be an awful row about it."</p>
<p><i>Corrected Example:</i>
<br>"I say, Graham, do you know what's happened?
<br>There'll be an awful row about it."</p>

<li><p>Make sure there is one blank line before each new paragraph, even if it starts at the top of a page. Do not add paragraph indentation. If a page starts in the middle of a paragraph, there should not be any blank lines at the top.

<p><i>Original Image:</i>
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;THE ship moved slowly out of the harbour as
<br>Tom Woodward slumped in his seat and breathed
<br>a sigh of relief.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He turned to the package he had dropped
<br>next to him on the deck and examined
<br>its label.</p>
<p><i>Corrected Example:</i>

<br>a sigh of relief. </p>
<p>He turned to the package he had dropped
<br>next to him on the deck and examined
<br>its label.</p>

<li><p>Remove extra space around punctuation. Make it look like common usage today.</p>
<p><i>Starting Text:</i>
<br>The girl looked at him with tears in her eyes ; she began
<br>to cry. " I'm so unhappy ! "</p>
<p><i>Corrected Example:</i>
<br>The girl looked at him with tears in her eyes; she began
<br>to cry. "I'm so unhappy!"</p>

<li><p>Remove spaces in words with contractions like "don't" and "isn't"</p>
<p><i>Original Image:</i>
<br>"Do n't!" he cried. "You 'll ruin the whole thing!"
<p><i>Corrected Example:</i>
<br>"Don't!" he cried. "You'll ruin the whole thing!"</p>

<li><p>Fix dashes by inserting additional hyphen character(s) if needed. Proofread these as two hyphens if the dash is as long as 2-3 letters (an em-dash) and four hyphens if the dash is as long as 4-5 letters (a long dash). Em-dashes are far more common than long dashes.  If a line ends with a dash, move the first word of the following line up to "clothe the naked dash", then insert a line break following the word you just moved. See the <a
href="http://www.pgdp.net/c/faq/proofreading_guidelines.php#em_dashes">Proofreading
Guidelines</a> for more details.</p>
<p><i>Original Image:</i>
<br>He walked over to the window&mdash;a strange look on his face&mdash;
<br>and tapped on the glass. "Susan!&mdash;&mdash; Over here!"
<p><i>Corrected Example:</i>
<br>He walked over to the window--a strange look on his face--and
<br>tapped on the glass. "Susan!----Over here!"</p>

<li><p>If you have a page with a poem on it, read the <a
href="http://www.pgdp.net/c/faq/proofreading_guidelines.php#poetry">Proofreading
Guidelines</a>, to see how to handle it. Set it off from surrounding text by making sure there is one blank line before and one blank line after the poem; do not indent the lines or try to center them.</p>

<li><p>Footnotes? Read the <a
href="http://www.pgdp.net/c/faq/proofreading_guidelines.php#footnotes">Proofreading
Guidelines</a>! Leave the note where it falls in the text box, and surround the footnote marker in the main body of the text with square brackets, e.g., [1] or [*].</p>

<li><p>Illustrations or Blank Pages? For illustrations, read the <a
href="http://www.pgdp.net/c/faq/proofreading_guidelines.php#illust">Proofreading
Guidelines</a>! Proofread the text of the captions, leaving the caption where it falls in the text box. If the caption text was omitted from the OCR'ed text, please type it in. If the illustration is captionless, add nothing. <a href="http://www.pgdp.net/c/faq/proofreading_guidelines.php#blank_pg">Blank Pages</a> occur in most books. If the scanned image is blank AND the text box is empty or says only <b>[Blank Page]</b>, do not mark the page bad; just save the page as done.</p>

<li><p><i>Italics?</i>, <span style="font-variant: small-caps">Small Caps?</span> or <b>Bold?</b> Just proofread the characters, and ignore the font variations. Do not mark or note them in the text; two rounds of formatting will follow the proofreading rounds, and formatters will insert the inline (and other) formatting mark-up.</p></ol>

<p><b>SHARING INFORMATION, ASKING QUESTIONS, REPORTING PROBLEMS:</b></p>
<p>This site has an internal message system. The number of unread private messages in your inbox is displayed on the dark green navbar found at the top of most pages. Please go to the forums and login to read your private messages from round 2 proofreaders. If you have questions that need a more immediate answer, please click on the "discuss this project" link in the project comments above. That will take you to a forum thread that is specific to this project where you can see what other new people have asked and can get reasonably quick responses from experienced proofreaders. There are also several other forums that you may use to ask questions or make comments that are not project-specific, and still others designed for amusement.</p>

<p>This book scanned and OCR'd pretty cleanly, but if you notice recurring OCR errors, please post a message in the discussion forum (as described above). That way, we will be alert for them in post-processing.</p>

<p><b>Thank you for volunteering at DP, and for your work on this book!</b></p>
