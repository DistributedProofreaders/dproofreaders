## phpunit tests

### Version requirements

The phpunit tests, as-coded, will work with phpunit 6.x, 7.x, 8.x, and 9.x.

### Running tests

`phpunit.xml` contains configuration information like bootstrap
requirements, so running the full suite is as simple as:
```bash
cd unittests
../../../vendor/bin/phpunit
```

To run the page compare test only:
```bash
../../../vendor/bin/phpunit PageCompareTest.php
```
