<p>
If window resize can cause the height of the splitter area to change then the body must have style 'overflow: hidden'. This is necessary because
the panes are absolutely positioned and given the height of their container. When the container becomes shorter we recalculate the height of the panes.
But this does not happen until after the browser has redrawn the layout based on the information it already has. If overflow is not hidden it will put in a vertical scroll bar.
This would make the client width of the contaner smaller causing  prevents getting incorrect container size
when using flex layout and window size is reducing
This happens because the height of the splitter divs is fixed so reducing
the window height would cause a scroll bar to appear, reducing the
client-width of the container, but we then change the height of the divs
so the scroll bar is not drawn.
