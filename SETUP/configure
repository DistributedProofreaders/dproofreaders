# We perform the replacements with a sed script, but the way we

# The 'set' command echoes name and value of each variable in the
# currently-running shell. This includes all the environment variables
# that the shell process inherited from its parent, the few variables
# that the script sets itself, and the variables that were defined in
# the site.config file. We're only interested in the last group, and we
# assume that we can catch them with the regular expression:
#    _[^=]+
# It's probably no big deal if this catches some variables from the
# other groups, because it's very unlikely that there would be
# corresponding <<...>> constructs in the code. And if there were,
# it would presumably be because there was a correspondingly-named
# variable defined in the site.config file, which would take precedence
# over any other.
