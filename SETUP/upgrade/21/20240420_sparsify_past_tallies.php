/*
This whole script could be accomplished with a single command:

    DELETE FROM past_tallies
    WHERE tally_delta = 0

However, the DELETE command locks the past_tallies table, forcing any other
queries on the table to wait. On pgdp.net, this wait would be so long that
we'd have to disable the site to do it. We'd prefer to avoid down-time, so
instead we take all that deleting and break it into many smaller chunks,
first by tallyboard and then by holder_id. Each chunk should be fairly quick,
and after each, we sleep a while to let the DB recover.
