Its \" British Almanac\" and \" Companion\r\nto the Almanac\" first appeared at the beginning of 1829.\r\nCharles Knight started also in that year his own \" Library of\r\nEntertaining Knowledge.\" John Murray\'s \" Family Library\"\r\nwas then begun, and in the spring of 1832--the year of the\r\nReform Bill--the advance of civilization by the diffusion of\r\ngood literature, through cheap journals as well as cheap\r\nbooks, was sought by the establishment of \" Chambers\'s\r\nEdinburgh Journal\" in the North, and in London of \" The\r\nPenny Magazine.\"\r\n\r\nIn the autumn of that year, 1832, on the 21st of\r\nSeptember, Sir Walter Scott died. The first warning of\r\ndeath had come to him in February, 1830, with a stroke\r\nof apoplexy. He had been visited by an old friend\r\nwho brought him <i>memoirfp!&fiftgs£</i> father, which he had\r\npromised to revise for tlwSjfi-?si»giiHe seemed for half',1451401657,'','',0,'','',0,'','',0,'','',0,'','','P1.page_avail','',0,'',''),('005','005.png','6 <i>INTRODUCTION</i>.\r\n\r\nan hour to be bending over the papers at his desk, and\r\nreading them; then he rose, staggered into the drawing-room,\r\nand fell, remaining speechless until he had been bled. Dieted\r\nfor weeks on pulse and water, he so far recovered that to\r\nfriends outside his family but little change in him was visible.\r\nIn that condition, in the month after his seizure, he was\r\nwriting these Letters, and also a fourth series of the \" Tales\r\nof a Grandfather.\" The slight softening of the brain found\r\nafter death had then begun. But the old delight in anecdote\r\nand skill in story-telling that, at the beginning of his career,\r\nhad caused a critic of his \" Border Minstrelsy\" to say that it\r\ncontained the germs of a hundred romances, yet survived.\r\nIt gave to Scott\'s \" Letters on Demonology and Witchcraft\"\r\nwhat is for us now a pathetic charm. Here and there some\r\nslight confusion of thought or style represents the nickering\r\nof a light that flashes yet with its old brilliancy. There is\r\nnot yet the manifest suggestion of the loss of power that we\r\nfind presently afterwards in \" Count Robert of Paris\" and\r\n\"Castle Dangerous,\" published in 1831 as the Fourth Series\r\nof \" Tales of My Landlord,\" with which he closed his life\'s\r\nwork at the age of sixty.\r\n\r\nMilton has said that he who would not be frustrate of his\r\nhope to write well in laudable things,-ought himself to be\r\na true poem. Scott\'s life was a true poem, of which the\r\nmusic entered into all he wrote. If in his earlier days the\r\nconsciousness of an unlimited productive power tempted\r\nhim to make haste to be rich, that he might work out, as\r\nfounder of a family, an ideal of life touched by his own\r\ngenius of romance, there was not in his desire for gain one\r\ntouch of sordid greed, and his ideal of life only brought\r\nhim closer home to all its duties. Sir Walter Scott\'s good\r\nsense, as Lord Cockburn said, was a more wonderful gift\r\nthan his genius. When the mistake of a trade connection\r\nwith James Ballantyne brought ruin to him in 1826, he\r\nrepudiated bankruptcy, took on himself the burden of a\r\ndebt of;£ 130,000, and sacrificed his life to the successful',1451401657,'','',0,'','',0,'','',0,'','',0,'','','P1.page_avail','',0,'',''),('006','006.png','<i>INTRODUCTION</i>. 7\r\n\r\nendeavour to pay off all. What was left unpaid at his death\r\nwas cleared afterwards by the success of his annotated\r\nedition of his novels. No tale of physical strife in the\r\nbattlefield could be as heroic as the story\'of the close of\r\nScott\'s life, with five years of a death-struggle against adversity,\r\nanimated by the truest sense of honour. When the\r\nruin was impending he wrote in his diary, \" If things go\r\nbadly in London, the magic wand of the Unknown will be\r\nshivered in his grasp. The feast of fancy will be over with\r\nthe feeling of independence. He shall no longer have the\r\ndelight of waking in the morning with bright ideas in his\r\nmind, hasten to commit them to paper, and count them\r\nmonthly, as the means of planting such scaurs and purchasing\r\nsuch wastes; replacing dreams of fiction by other prospective\r\nvisions of walks by\r\n\r\n\' Fountain-heads, and pathless groves;\r\nPlaces which pale passion loves.\'\r\n\r\nThis cannot be; but I may work substantial husbandry--\r\nwrite history, and such concerns.\" It was under\r\npressure of calamity like this that Sir Walter Scott\r\nwas compelled to make himself known as the author of\r\n\"Waverley.\" Closely upon this followed the death of his\r\nwife, his thirty years\' companion. \" I have been to her\r\nroom,\" he wrote in May, 1826; \" there was no voice in it--no\r\nstirring; the pressure of the coffin was visible on the\r\nbed, but it had \'been removed elsewhere; all was neat as she\r\nloved it, but all was calm--calm as death. I remembered\r\nthe last sight of her: she raised herself in bed, and tried to\r\nturn her eyes after me, and said with a sort of smile, \' You\r\nhave all such melancholy faces.\' These were the last words\r\nI ever heard her utter, and I hurried away, for she did not\r\nseem quite conscious of what she said; when I returned,\r\nimmediately departing, she was in a deep sleep.

Oh, my God!\"\r\n\r\nA few years yet of his own battle, while the shadows of\r\nnight and death were gathering about him, and they were\r\nre-united. In these \" Letters upon Demonology and\r\nWitchcraft,\" addressed to his son-in-law, written under the\r\nfirst grasp of death, the old kindliness and good sense, joined\r\nto the old charm in story-telling, stand firm yet against\r\nevery assault; and even in the decay that followed, when the\r\npowers were broken of the mind that had breathed, and is\r\nstill breathing, its own health into the minds of tens of\r\nthousands of his countrymen, nothing could break the fine\r\nspirit of love and honour that was in him. When the end\r\nwas very near, and the son-in-law to whom these Letters\r\nwere addressed found him one morning entirely himself,\r\nthough in the last extreme of feebleness: his eye was clear\r\nand calm--every trace of the wild fire of delirium was\r\nextinguished: \" Lockhart,\" he said, \" I may have but a\r\nminute to speak to you. My dear, be a good man--be\r\nvirtuous, be religious--be a good man. Nothing else will\r\ngive you any comfort when you come to lie here.\"\r\n\r\nAnother volume of this Library may give occasion to\r\nrecall Scott in the noontide of his strength, companion of\r\n\r\n\"The blameless Muse who trains her sons\r\nFor hope and calm enjoyment.\"\r\n\r\nHere we remember only how from among dark clouds the\r\nlast light of his genius shone on the path of those who\r\nwere endeavouring to make the daily bread of intellectual\r\nlife--good books--common to all.\r\n\r\nH.

And, of late years, the very curious\r\nextracts published by Mr. Pitcairn, from the Criminal\r\nRecords of Scotland, are, besides their historical value,\r\nof a nature so much calculated to illustrate the credulity of\r\nour ancestors on such subjects, that, by perusing them, I\r\nhave been induced more recently to recall what I had read\r\nand thought upon the subject at a former period.\r\n\r\nAs, however, my information is only miscellaneous, and I\r\nmake no pretensions, either to combat the systems of those\r\nby whom I am anticipated in consideration of the subject,\r\nor to erect any new one of my own, my purpose is, after a\r\ngeneral account of Deraonology and Witchcraft, to confine\r\nmyself to narratives of remarkable cases, and to the observations\r\nwhich naturally and easily arise out of them;--in\r\nthe confidence that such a plan is, at the present time of\r\nday, more likely to suit the pages of a popular miscellany,\r\nthan an attempt to reduce the contents of many hundred\r\ntomes, from the largest to the smallest size, into an abridgement,\r\nwhich, however compressed, must remain greatly too\r\nlarge for the reader\'s powers of patience. \"<i>_{t</i>}',1451401657,'','',0,'','',0,'','',0,'','',0,'','','P1.page_avail','',0,'',''),('010','010.png','<i>DEMONOLOGY AND WITCHCRAFT</i>, n\r\n\r\nA few general remarks on the nature of Demonology,\r\nand the original cause of the almost universal belief in\r\ncommunication betwixt mortals and beings of a power\r\nsuperior to themselves, and of a nature not to be comprehended\r\nby human organs, are a necessary introduction to\r\nthe subject.\r\n\r\nThe general, or, it may be termed, the universal belief of\r\nthe inhabitants of the earth, in the existence of spirits separated\r\nfrom the encumbrance and incapacities of the body, is\r\ngrounded on the consciousness of the divinity that speaks in\r\nour bosoms, and demonstrates to all men, except the few\r\nwho are hardened to the celestial voice, that there is within\r\nus a portion of the divine substance, which is not subject to\r\nthe law of death and dissolution, but which, when the body\r\nis no longer fit for its abode, shall seek its own place, as a\r\nsentinel dismissed from his post. Unaided by revelation, it\r\ncannot be hoped that mere earthly reason should be able to\r\nform any rational or precise conjecture concerning the destination\r\nof the soul when parted from the body; but the\r\nconviction that such an indestructible essence exists, the\r\nbelief expressed by the poet in a different sense, <i>Non omnis\r\nmoriar,</i> must infer the existence of many millions of spirits\r\nwho have not been annihilated, though they have become\r\ninvisible to mortals who still see, hear, and perceive, only\r\nby means of the imperfect organs of humanity. Probability\r\nmay lead some of the most reflecting to anticipate a state of\r\nfuture rewards and punishments; as those experienced in\r\nthe education of the deaf and dumb find that their pupils,\r\neven while cut off from all instruction by ordinary means,\r\nhave been able to form, out of their own unassisted conjectures,\r\nsome ideas of the existence of a Deity, and of the distinction\r\nbetween the soul and body--a circumstance which\r\nproves how naturally these truths arise in the human mind.\r\nThe principle that they do so arise, being taught or communicated,\r\nleads to further conclusions.\r\nThese spirits, in a state of separate existence, being',1451401657,'','',0,'','',0,'','',0,'','',0,'','','P1.page_avail','',0,'',''),('011','011.png','12 <i>LETTERS ON</i>\r\n\r\nadmitted to exist, are not, it may be supposed, indifferent\r\nto the affairs of mortality, perhaps not incapable of influencing\r\nthem. It is true that, in a more advanced state of\r\nsociety, the philosopher may challenge the possibility of a\r\nseparate appearance of a disembodied spirit, unless in the\r\ncase of a direct miracle, to which, being a suspension of the\r\nlaws of nature, directly wrought by the Maker of these laws,\r\nfor some express purpose, no bound or restraint can possibly\r\nbe assigned. But under this necessary limitation and exception,\r\nphilosophers might plausibly argue that, when the soul\r\nis divorced from the body, it loses all those qualities which\r\nmade it, when clothed with a mortal shape, obvious to the\r\norgans of its fellow-men. The abstract idea of a spirit certainly\r\nimplies that it has neither substance, form, shape,\r\nvoice, or anything which can render its presence visible or\r\nsensible to human faculties. But these sceptic doubts of\r\nphilosophers on the possibility of the appearance of such\r\nseparated spirits, do not arise till a certain degree of information\r\nhas dawned upon a country, and even then only\r\nreach a very small proportion of reflecting and better-informed\r\nmembers of society. To the multitude, the indubitable\r\nfact, that so many millions of spirits exist around\r\nand even amongst us, seems sufficient to support the belief\r\nthat they are, in certain instances at least, by some means or\r\nother, able to communicate with the world of humanity.\r\nThe more numerous part of mankind cannot form in their\r\nmind the idea of the spirit of the deceased existing, without\r\npossessing or having the power to assume the appearance\r\nwhich their acquaintance bore during his life, and do not\r\npush their researches beyond this point.\r\n\r\nEnthusiastic feelings of an impressive and solemn nature\r\noccur both in private and public life, which seem to add\r\nocular testimony to an intercourse betwixt earth and the\r\nworld beyond it. For example, the son who has been\r\nlately deprived of his father feels a sudden crisis approach,\r\nin which he is anxious to have recourse to his sagacious',1451401657,'','',0,'','',0,'','',0,'','',0,'','','P1.page_avail','',0,'',''),('012','012.png','<i>DEMONOLOGY AND WITCHCRAFT</i>. 1.3\r\n\r\nadvice--or a bereaved husband earnestly desires again to\r\nbehold the form of which the grave has deprived him for\r\never--or, to use a darker yet very common instance, the\r\nwretched man who has dipped his hand in his fellow-creature\'s\r\nblood, is haunted by the apprehension that the phantom\r\nof the slain stands by the bedside of his murderer. In\r\nall or any of these cases, who shall doubt that imagination,\r\nfavoured by circumstances, has power to summon up to the\r\norgan of sight, spectres which only exist in the mind of\r\nthose by whom their apparition seems to be witnessed?\r\n\r\nIf we add, that such a vision may take place in the course\r\nof one of those lively dreams in which the patient, except in\r\nrespect to the single subject of one strong impression, is, or\r\nseems, sensible of the real particulars of the scene around\r\nhim, a state of slumber which often occurs; if he is so far\r\nconscious, for example, as to know that he <i>is</i> lying on his\r\nown bed, and surrounded by his own familiar furniture\r\nat the time when the supposed apparition is manifested,\r\nit becomes almost in vain to argue with the visionary\r\nagainst the reality of his dream, since the spectre,\r\nthough itself purely fanciful, is inserted amidst so many\r\ncircumstances which he feels must be true beyond the reach\r\nof doubt or question. That which is undeniably certain\r\nbecomes, in a manner, a warrant for the reality of the\r\nappearance to which doubt would have been otherwise\r\nattached. And if any event, such as the death of the\r\nperson dreamt of, chances to take place, so as to correspond\r\nwith the nature and the time of the apparition, the coincidence,\r\nthough one which must be frequent, since our\r\ndreams usually refer to the accomplishment of that which\r\nhaunts our minds when awake, and often presage the most\r\nprobable events, seems perfect, and the chain of circumstances\r\ntouching the evidence may not unreasonably be\r\nconsidered as complete. Such a concatenation, we repeat,\r\nmust frequently take place, when it is considered of what\r\nstuff dreams are made--how naturally they turn upon those',1451401657,'','',0,'','',0,'','',0,'','',0,'','','P1.page_avail','',0,'',''),('013','013.png','i_{4}<i>LETTERS ON</i>\r\n\r\nwho occupy our mind while awake, and, when a soldier is\r\nexposed to death in battle, when a sailor is incurring the\r\ndangers of the sea, when <i>a</i>. beloved wife or relative is attacked\r\nby disease, how readily our sleeping imagination\r\nrushes to the very point of alarm, which when waking it\r\nhad shuddered to anticipate. The number of instances in\r\nwhich such lively dreams have been quoted, and both\r\nasserted and received as spiritual communications, is very\r\ngreat at all periods; in ignorant times, where the natural\r\ncause of dreaming is misapprehended and confused with an\r\nidea of mysticism, it is much greater. Yet, perhaps, considering\r\nthe many thousands of dreams which must, night\r\nafter night, pass through the imagination of individuals, the\r\nnumber of coincidences between the vision and real event\r\nare fewer and less remarkable than a fair calculation of\r\nchances would warrant us to expect. But in countries\r\nwhere such presaging dreams are subjects of attention, the\r\nnumber of those which seemed.to be coupled with the\r\ncorresponding issue, is large enough to spread a very general\r\nbelief of a positive communication betwixt the living and\r\nthe dead.\r\n\r\nSomnambulism and other nocturnal deceptions frequently\r\nlend their aid to the formation of such <i>p\"hantasmata</i> as are\r\nformed in this middle state, betwixt sleeping and waking. A\r\nmost respectable person, whose active life had been spent as\r\nmaster and part owner of a large merchant vessel in the\r\nLisbon trade, gave the writer an account of such an instance\r\nwhich came under his observation. He was lying in the\r\nTagus, when he was put to great anxiety and alarm by the\r\nfollowing incident and its consequences. One of his crew\r\nwas murdered by a Portuguese assassin, and a report arose\r\nthat the ghost of the slain man haunted the vessel. Sailors\r\nare generally superstitious, and those of my friend\'s vessel\r\nbecame unwilling to remain on board the ship; and it\r\nwas probable they might desert rather then return to\r\nEngland with the ghost for a passenger. To prevent so',1451401657,'','',0,'','',0,'','',0,'','',0,'','','P1.page_avail','',0,'',''),('014','014.png','<i>t)EMONOLOGY AND WITCHCRAFT</i>. 15\r\n\r\ngreat a calamity, the captain determined to examine the\r\nstory to the bottom. He soon found that, though all pretended\r\nto have seen lights and heard noises, and so forth,\r\nthe weight of the evidence lay upon the statement of one of\r\nhis own mates, an Irishman and a Catholic, which might increase\r\nhis tendency to superstition, but in other respects a\r\nveracious, honest, and sensible person, whom Captain----had\r\nno reason to suspect would wilfully deceive him. He\r\naffirmed to Captain S----with the deepest obtestations,\r\nthat the spectre of the murdered man appeared to him\r\nalmost nightly, took him from his place in the vessel, and,\r\naccording to his own expression, worried his life out. He\r\nmade these communications with a degree of horror which\r\nintimated the reality of his distress and apprehensions. The\r\ncaptain, without any argument at the time, privately resolved\r\nto watch the motions of the ghost-seer in the night;\r\nwhether alone, or with a witness, I have forgotten. As the\r\nship bell struck twelve, the sleeper started up, with a ghastly\r\nand disturbed countenance, and lighting a candle, proceeded\r\nto the galley or cook-room of the vessel. He sate down\r\nwith his eyes open, staring before him as on some terrible\r\nobject which he beheld with horror, yet from which he\r\ncould not withhold his eyes. After a short space he arose,\r\ntook up a tin can or decanter, filled it with water, muttering\r\nto himself all the while--mixed salt in the water, and\r\nsprinkled it about the galley. Finally, he sighed deeply,\r\nlike one relieved from a heavy burden, and, returning to his\r\nhammock, slept soundly. In the next morning the haunted\r\nman told the usual precise story of his apparition, with the\r\nadditional circumstances, that the ghost had led him to the\r\ngalley, but that he had fortunately, he knew not how, obtained\r\npossession of some holy water, and succeeded in\r\ngetting rid of his unwelcome visitor. The visionary was\r\nthen informed of the real transactions of the night, with so\r\nmany particulars as to satisfy him he had been the dupe of\r\nhis imagination; he acquiesced in his commander\'s reason-',1451401657,'','',0,'','',0,'','',0,'','',0,'','','P1.page_avail','',0,'',''),('015','015.png','16 <i>LETTERS ON</i>\r\n\r\ning, and the dream, as often happens in these cases, returned\r\nno more after its imposture had been detected. In\r\nthis case, we find the excited imagination acting upon the\r\nhalf-waking senses, which were intelligent enough for the\r\npurpose of making him sensible where he was, but not\r\nsufficiently so to judge truly of the objects before him.\r\n\r\nBut it is not only private life alone, or that tenor of\r\nthought which has been depressed into melancholy by\r\ngloomy anticipations respecting the future, which disposes\r\nthe mind to mid-day fantasies, or to nightly apparitions--a\r\nstate of eager anxiety, or excited exertion, is equally favourable\r\nto the indulgence of such supernatural communications.\r\nThe anticipation of a dubious battle, with all the doubt and\r\nuncertainty of its event, and the conviction that it must involve\r\nhis own fate and that of his country, was powerful\r\nenough to conjure up to the anxious eye of Brutus the\r\nspectre of his murdered friend Cssar, respecting whose\r\ndeath he perhaps thought himself less justified than at the\r\nIdes of March, since, instead of having achieved the freedom\r\nof Rome, the event had only been the renewal of civil wars,\r\nand the issue might appear most likely to conclude in the\r\ntotal subjection of liberty. It is not miraculous that the\r\nmasculine spirit of Marcus Brutus, surrounded by darkness\r\nand solitude, distracted probably by recollection of the\r\nkindness and favour of the great individual whom he had put\r\nto death to avenge the wrongs of his country, though by the\r\nslaughter of his own friend, should at length place before\r\nhis eyes in person the appearance which termed itself his\r\nevil genius, and promised again to meet him at Philippi.\r\nBrutus\' own intentions, and his knowledge of the military\r\nart, had probably long since assured him that the decision\r\nof the civil war must take place at or near that place; and,\r\nallowing that his own imagination supplied that part of his\r\ndialogue with the spectre, there is nothing else which might\r\nnot be fashioned in a vivid dream or a waking reverie,\r\napproaching, in absorbing and engrossing character, the',1451401657,'','',0,'','',0,'','',0,'','',0,'','','P1.page_avail','',0,'',''),('016','016.png','<i>DEMONOLOGY AND WITCHCRAFT</i>.  17\r\n\r\nusual matter of which dreams consist. That Brutus, well\r\nacquainted with the opinions of the Platonists, should be\r\ndisposed to receive without doubt the idea that he had seen\r\na real apparition, and was not likely to scrutinize very\r\nminutely the supposed vision, may be naturally conceived;\r\nand it is also natural to think, that although no one saw the\r\nfigure but himself, his contemporaries were little disposed to\r\nexamine the testimony of a man so eminent, by the strict\r\nrules of cross-examination and conflicting evidence, which\r\nthey might have thought applicable to another person, and a\r\nless dignified occasion.\r\n\r\nEven in the field of death, and amid the mortal tug of\r\ncombat itself, strong belief has wrought the same wonder,\r\nwhich we have hitherto mentioned as occurring in solitude\r\nand amid darkness; and those who were themselves on the\r\nverge of the world of spirits, or employed in dispatching\r\nothers to these gloomy regions, conceived they beheld the\r\napparitions of those beings whom their national mythology\r\nassociated with such scenes. In such moments of undecided\r\nbattle, amid the violence, hurry, and confusion of ideas\r\nincident to the situation, the ancients supposed that they\r\nsaw their deities, Castor and Pollux, fighting in the van for\r\ntheir encouragement; the heathen Scandinavian beheld the\r\nChoosers of the slain; and the Catholics were no less easily\r\nled to recognize the warlike Saint George or Saint James in\r\nthe very front of the strife, showing them the way to conquest.\r\nSuch apparitions being generally visible to a multitude,\r\nhave in all times been supported by the greatest\r\nstrength of testimony. When the common feeling of danger,\r\nand the animating burst of enthusiasm, act on the feelings of\r\nmany men at once, their minds hold a natural correspondence\r\nwith each other, as it is said is the case with stringed\r\ninstruments tuned to the same pitch, of which, when one is\r\nplayed, the chords of the others are supposed to vibrate in\r\nunison with the tones produced. If an artful or enthusiastic\r\nindividual exclaims, itfrttye/Heat of action, that he per-\r\n<i>m</i>',1451401657,'','',0,'','',0,'','',0,'','',0,'','','P1.page_avail','',0,'',''),('017','017.png','i8 <i>LETTERS ON</i>\r\n\r\nceives an apparition of the romantic kind which has been\r\nintimated, his companions catch at the idea with emulation,\r\nand most are willing to sacrifice the conviction of their own\r\nsenses, rather than allow that they did not witness the same\r\nfavourable emblem, from which all draw confidence and\r\nhope. One warrior catches the idea from another; all are\r\nalike eager to acknowledge the present miracle, and the\r\nbattle is won before the mistake is discovered. In such\r\ncases, the number of persons present, which would otherwise\r\nlead to detection of the fallacy, becomes the means of\r\nstrengthening it.\r\n\r\nOf this disposition, to see as much of the supernatural as\r\nis seen by others around, or, in other words, to trust to the\r\neyes of others rather than to our own, we may take the\r\nliberty to quote two remarkable instances.\r\n\r\nThe first is from the \" Historia Verdadera\" of Don Bernal\r\nBias del Castillo, one of the companions of the celebrated\r\nCortez in his Mexican conquest. After having given an\r\naccount of a great victory over extreme odds, he mentions\r\nthe report inserted in the contemporary Chronicle of Go-mara,\r\nthat Saint lago had appeared on a white horse in van\r\nof the combat, and led on his beloved Spaniards to victory.\r\nIt is very curious to observe the Castilian cavalier\'s internal\r\nconviction that the rumour arose out of a mistake, the cause\r\nof which he explains from his own observation; whilst, at\r\nthe same time, he does not venture to disown the miracle.\r\nThe honest Conquestador owns that he himself did not see\r\nthis animating vision; nay, that he beheld an individual\r\ncavalier, named Francisco de Morla, mounted on a chestnut\r\nhorse, and fighting strenuously in the very place where Saint\r\nJames is said to have appeared. But instead of proceeding\r\nto draw the necessary inference, the devout Conquestador\r\nexclaims--\" Sinner that I am, what am I that I should have\r\nbeheld the blessed apostle!\"\r\n\r\nThe other instance of the infectious character of superstition\r\noccurs in a Scottish book, and there can be little',1451401657,'','',0,'','',0,'','',0,'','',0,'','','P1.page_avail','',0,'',''),('018','018.png','<i>DEMONOLOGY AND WITCHCRAFT</i>. 19\r\n\r\ndoubt that it refers, in its first origin, to some uncommon\r\nappearance of the aurora borealis, or the northern lights,\r\nwhich do not appear to have been seen in Scotland so frequently\r\nas to be accounted a common and familiar atmospherical\r\nphenomenon, until the beginning of the eighteenth\r\ncentury. The passage is striking and curious, for the narrator,\r\nPeter Walker, though an enthusiast, was a man of\r\ncredit, and does not even affect to have seen the wonders,\r\nthe reality of which he unscrupulously adopts on the testimony\r\nof others, to whose eyes he trusted rather than to his\r\nown. The conversion of the sceptical gentleman of whom\r\nhe speaks is highly illustrative of popular credulity carried\r\naway into enthusiasm, or into imposture, by the evidence of\r\nthose around, and at once shows the imperfection of such a\r\ngeneral testimony, and the ease with which it is procured,\r\nsince the general excitement of the moment impels even the\r\nmore cold-blooded and judicious persons present to catch\r\nup the ideas and echo the exclamations of the majority,\r\nwho, from the first, had considered the heavenly phenomenon\r\nas a supernatural weapon-schaw, held for the purpose of a\r\nsign and warning of civil wars to come.\r\n\r\n\"In the year 1686, in the months of June and July,\" says\r\nthe honest chronicler, \" many yet alive can witness that\r\nabout the Crossford Boat, two miles beneath Lanark, especially\r\nat the Mains, on the water of Clyde, many people\r\ngathered together for several afternoons, where there were\r\nshowers of bonnets, hats, guns, and swords, which covered\r\nthe trees and the ground; companies of men in arms marching\r\nin order upon the waterside; companies meeting companies,\r\ngoing all through other, and then all falling to the\r\nground and disappearing; other companies immediately\r\nappeared, marching the same way. I went there three afternoons\r\ntogether, and, as I observed, there were two-thirds of\r\nthe people that were together saw, and a third that saw not;\r\nand, <i>though I could see nothing</i>, there was such a fright and\r\ntrembling on those that did see, that was discernible to all',1451401657,'','',0,'','',0,'','',0,'','',0,'','','P1.page_avail','',0,'',''),('019','019.png','20 <i>LETTERS ON</i>\r\n\r\nfrom those that saw not.

In other\r\nrespects their blood beat temperately, they possessed the\r\nordinary capacity of ascertaining the truth or discerning the\r\nfalsehood of external appearances by an appeal to the organ\r\nof sight. Unfortunately, however, as is now universally\r\nknown and admitted, there certainly exists more than one\r\ndisorder known to professional men of which one important\r\nsymptom is a disposition to see apparitions.\r\n\r\nThis frightful disorder is not properly insanity, although\r\nit is somewhat allied to that most horrible of maladies, and\r\nmay, in many constitutions, be the means of bringing it on,\r\nand although such hallucinations are proper to both. The\r\ndifference I conceive to be that, in cases of insanity, the\r\nmind of the patient is principally affected, while the senses,\r\nor organic system, offer in vain to the lunatic their decided\r\ntestimony against the fantasy of a deranged imagination.\r\nPerhaps the nature of this collision--between a disturbed\r\nimagination and organs of sense possessed of their usual\r\naccuracy--cannot be better described than in the embarrassment\r\nexpressed by an insane patient confined in the Infirmary\r\nof Edinburgh. The poor man\'s malady had taken a gay\r\nturn. The house, in his idea, was his own, and he contrived\r\nto account for all that seemed inconsistent with his\r\nimaginary right of property--there were many patients in it,\r\nbut that was owing to the benevolence of his nature, which\r\nmade him love to see the relief of distress. He went little,\r\nor rather never abroad--but then his habits were of a\r\ndomestic and rather sedentary character. He did not see\r\nmuch company--but he daily received visits from the first\r\ncharacters in the renowned medical school of this city, and\r\nhe could not therefore be much in want of society. With\r\nso many supposed comforts around him--with so many\r\nvisions of wealth and splendour--one thing alone disturbed\r\nthe peace of the poor optimist, and would indeed have confounded\r\nmost <i>bans vivants</i>. \" He was curious,\" he said, \"in',1451401657,'','',0,'','',0,'','',0,'','',0,'','','P1.page_avail','',0,'',''),('021','021.png','22 <i>LETTERS ON</i>\r\n\r\nhis table, choice in his selection of cooks, had every day a\r\ndinner of three regular courses and a dessert; and yet,\r\nsomehow or other, everything he eat <i>tasted of porridge.\"\r\n</i> This dilemma could be no great wonder to the friend to\r\nwhom the poor patient communicated it, who knew the\r\nlunatic eat nothing but this simple aliment at any of his\r\nmeals.

The disease lay in the extreme\r\nvivacity of the patient\'s imagination, deluded in other\r\ninstances, yet not absolutely powerful enough to contend with\r\nthe honest evidence of his stomach and palate, which, like\r\nLord Peter\'s brethren in \" The Tale of a Tub,\" were indignant\r\nat the attempt to impose boiled oatmeal upon them,\r\ninstead of such a banquet as Ude would have displayed\r\nwhen peers were to partake of it. Here, therefore, is one\r\ninstance of actual insanity, in which the sense of taste controlled\r\nand attempted to restrain the ideal hypothesis adopted\r\nby a deranged imagination. But the disorder to. which I\r\npreviously alluded is entirely of a bodily character, and\r\nconsists principally in a disease of the visual organs, which\r\npresent to the patient a set of spectres or appearances\r\nwhich have no actual existence. It is a disease of the same\r\nnature which renders many men incapable of distinguishing\r\ncolours; only the patients go a step further, and pervert\r\nthe external form of objects. In their case, therefore, contrary\r\nto that of the maniac, it is not the mind, or rather the\r\nimagination, which imposes upon and overpowers the\r\nevidence of the senses, but the sense of seeing (or hearing)\r\nwhich betrays its duty and conveys false ideas to a sane\r\nintellect.\r\n\r\nMore than one learned physician, who have given their\r\nattestations to the existence of this most distressing complaint,\r\nhave agreed that it actually occurs, and is occasioned\r\nby different causes. The most frequent source of\r\nthe malady is in the dissipated and intemperate habits of\r\nthose who, by a continued series of intoxication, become\r\nsubject to what is popularly called the Blue Devils, in-',1451401657,'','',0,'','',0,'','',0,'','',0,'','','P1.page_avail','',0,'',''),('022','022.png','<i>DEMONOLOGY AND WITCHCRAFT</i>. 23\r\n\r\nStances of which mental disorder may be known to most\r\nwho have lived for any period of their lives in society where\r\nhard drinking was a common vice. The joyous visions\r\nsuggested by intoxication when the habit is first acquired,\r\nin time disappear, and are supplied by frightful impressions\r\nand scenes, which destroy the tranquillity of the unhappy\r\ndebauchee. Apparitions of the most unpleasant appearance\r\nare his companions in solitude, and intrude even upon\r\nhis hours of society: and when by an alteration of habits,\r\nthe mind is cleared of these frightful ideas, it requires but\r\nthe slightest renewal of the association to bring back the\r\nfull tide of misery upon the repentant libertine.\r\n\r\nOf this the following instance was told to the author by a\r\ngentleman connected with the sufferer. A young man of\r\nfortune, who had led what is called so gay a life as considerably\r\nto injure both his health and fortune, was at length\r\nobliged to consult the physician upon the means of restoring,\r\nat least, the former. One of his principal complaints\r\nwas the frequent presence of a set of apparitions, resembling\r\na band of figures dressed in green, who performed in\r\nhis drawing-room a singular dance, to which he was compelled\r\nto bear witness, though he knew, to his great annoyance,\r\nthat the whole <i>corps de ballet</i> existed only in his own\r\nimagination. His physician immediately informed him that\r\nhe had lived upon town too long and too fast not to require\r\nan exchange to a more healthy and natural course of life.\r\nHe therefore prescribed a gentle course of medicine, but\r\nearnestly recommended to his patient to retire to his own\r\nhouse in the country, observe a temperate diet and early\r\nhours, practising regular exercise, on the same principle\r\navoiding fatigue, and assured him that by doing so he might\r\nbid adieu to black spirits and white, blue, green, and grey,\r\nwith all their trumpery. The patient observed the advice,\r\nand prospered. His physician, after the interval of a\r\nmonth, received a grateful letter from him, acknowledging\r\nthe success of his regimen. The greens goblins had dis-',1451401657,'','',0,'','',0,'','',0,'','',0,'','','P1.page_avail','',0,'',''),('023','023.png','24 <i>LETTERS ON</i>\r\n\r\nappeared, and with them the unpleasant train of emotions\r\nto which their visits had given rise, and the patient had\r\nordered his town-house to be disfurnished and sold, while\r\nthe furniture was to be sent down to his residence in the\r\ncountry, where he was determined in future to spend his\r\nlife, without exposing himself to the temptations of town.\r\nOne would have supposed this a well-devised scheme for\r\nhealth. But, alas! no sooner had the furniture of the\r\nLondon drawing-room been placed in order in the gallery\r\nof the old manor-house, than the former delusion returned\r\nin full force: the green <i>figurantes</i>, whom the patient\'s depraved\r\nimagination had so long associated with these move-ables,\r\ncame capering and frisking to accompany them, exclaiming\r\nwith great glee, as if the sufferer should have been\r\nrejoiced to see them, \" Here we all are--here we all are!\"\r\nThe visionary, if I recollect right, was so much shocked at\r\ntheir appearance, that he retired abroad, in despair that any\r\npart of Britain could shelter him from the daily persecution\r\nof this domestic ballet.\r\n\r\nThere is reason to believe that such cases are numerous,\r\nand that they may perhaps arise not only from the debility\r\nof stomach brought on by excess in wine or spirits, which\r\nderangement often sensibly affects the eyes and sense of\r\nsight, but also because the mind becomes habitually predominated\r\nover by a train of fantastic visions, the consequence\r\nof frequent intoxication; and is thus, like a dislocated\r\njoint, apt again to go wrong, even when a different\r\ncause occasions the derangement.\r\n\r\nIt is easy to be supposed that habitual excitement by\r\nmeans of any other intoxicating drug, as opium, or its\r\nvarious substitutes, must expose those who practise the\r\ndangerous custom to the same inconvenience. Very frequent\r\nuse of the nitrous oxide which affects the senses so\r\nstrongly, and produces a short but singular state of ecstasy,\r\nwould probably be found to occasion this species of disorder.\r\nBut there are many other causes which medical men',1451401657,'','',0,'','',0,'','',0,'','',0,'','','P1.page_avail','',0,'',''),('024','024.png','<i>DEMONOLOGY AND WITCHCRAFT</i>. 25\r\n\r\nfind attended with the same symptom, of embodying before\r\nthe eyes of a patient imaginary illusions which are visible\r\nto no one else. This persecution of spectral deceptions is\r\nalso found to exist when no excesses of the patient can be\r\nalleged as the cause, owing, doubtless, to a deranged state\r\nof the blood or nervous system.\r\n\r\nThe learned and acute Dr. Ferriar of Manchester was the\r\nfirst who brought before the English public the leading case,\r\nas it may be called, in this department, namely, that of\r\nMons. Nicolai, the celebrated bookseller of Berlin. This\r\ngentleman was not a man merely of books, but of letters,\r\nand had the moral courage to lay before the Philosophical\r\nSociety of Berlin an account of his own sufferings, from\r\nhaving been, by disease, subjected to a series of spectral\r\nillusions. The leading circumstances of this case may be\r\nstated very shortly, as it has been repeatedly before the\r\npublic, and is insisted on by Dr. Ferriar, Dr. Hibbert, and\r\nothers who have assumed Demonology as a subject.\r\nNicolai traces his illness remotely to a series of disagreeable\r\nincidents which had happened to him in the beginning\r\nof the year 1791. The depression of spirits which was\r\noccasioned by these unpleasant occurrences, was aided by\r\nthe consequences of neglecting a course of periodical bleeding\r\nwhich he had been accustomed to observe. This state\r\nof health brought on the disposition to see <i>phantasmata</i>, who\r\nvisited, or it may be more properly said frequented, the\r\napartments of the learned bookseller, presenting crowds of\r\npersons who moved and acted before him, nay, even spoke\r\nto and addressed him. These phantoms afforded nothing\r\nunpleasant to the imagination of the visionary either in\r\nsight or expression, and the patient was possessed of too\r\nmuch firmness to be otherwise affected by their presence\r\nthan with a species of curiosity, as he remained convinced\r\nfrom the beginning to the end of the disorder, that these\r\nsingular effects were merely symptoms of the state of his\r\nhealth, and did not in any other respect regard rtiem as',1451401657,'','',0,'','',0,'','',0,'','',0,'','','P1.page_avail','',0,'',''),('025','025.png','26 <i>LETTERS ON</i>\r\n\r\na subject of apprehension. After a certain time, and some\r\nuse of medicine, the phantoms became less distinct in their\r\noutline, less vivid in their colouring, faded, as it were, on\r\nthe eye of the patient, and at length totally disappeared.\r\n\r\nThe case of Nicolai has unquestionably been that of\r\nmany whose love of science has not been able to overcome\r\ntheir natural reluctance to communicate to the public the\r\nparticulars attending the visitation of a disease so peculiar.\r\nThat such illnesses have been experienced, and have ended\r\nfatally, there can be no doubt; though it is by no means to\r\nbe inferred, that the symptom of importance to our present\r\ndiscussion has, on all occasions, been produced from the\r\nsame identical cause.\r\n\r\nDr. Hibbert, who has most ingeniously, as well as\r\nphilosophically, handled this subject, has treated it also in a\r\nmedical point of view, with science to which we make no\r\npretence, and a precision of detail to which our superficial\r\ninvestigation affords us no room for extending ourselves.\r\n\r\nThe visitation of spectral phenomena is described by this\r\nlearned gentleman as incidental to sundry complaints; and\r\nhe mentions, in particular, that the symptom occurs not only\r\nin plethora, as in the case of the learned Prussian we have\r\njust mentioned, but is a frequent hectic symptom--often an\r\nassociate of febrile and inflammatory disorders--frequently\r\naccompanying inflammation of the brain--a concomitant\r\nalso of highly excited nervous irritability--equally connected\r\nwith hypochondria--and finally united in some cases with\r\ngout, and in others with the effects of excitation produced\r\nby several gases. In all these cases there seems to be a\r\nmorbid degree of sensibility, with which this symptom is\r\nready to ally itself, and which, though inaccurate as a\r\nmedical definition, may be held sufficiently descriptive of\r\none character of the various kinds of disorder with which\r\nthis painful symptom may be found allied.\r\n\r\nA very singular and interesting illustration of such combinations\r\nas Dr. Hibbert has recorded of the spectral illusion',1451401657,'','',0,'','',0,'','',0,'','',0,'','','P1.page_avail','',0,'',''),('026','026.png','<i>DEMONOLOGY AND WITCHCRAFT</i>.  27\r\n\r\nwith an actual disorder, and that of a dangerous kind, was\r\nfrequently related in society by the late learned and accomplished\r\nDr. Gregory of Edinburgh, and sometimes, I\r\nbelieve, quoted by him in his lectures. The narrative, to\r\nthe author\'s best recollection, was as follows:--A patient of\r\nDr. Gregory, a person, it is understood, of some rank,\r\nhaving requested the doctor\'s advice, made the following\r\nextraordinary statement of his complaint. \" I am in the\r\nhabit,\" he said, \" of dining at five, and exactly as the hour\r\nof six arrives I am subjected to the following painful visitation.\r\nThe door of the room, even when I have been weak\r\nenough to bolt it, which I have sometimes done, flies wide\r\nopen; an old hag, like one of those who haunted the heath\r\nof Forres, enters with a frowning and incensed countenance,\r\ncomes straight up to me with every demonstration of spite\r\nand indignation which could characterize her who haunted\r\nthe merchant Abudah in the Oriental tale; she rushes upon\r\nme, says something, but so hastily that I cannot discover\r\nthe purport, and then strikes me a severe blow with her\r\nstaff. I fall from my chair in a swoon, which is of longer\r\nor shorter endurance. To the recurrence of this apparition\r\nI am daily subjected. And such is my new and singular\r\ncomplaint.\" The doctor immediately asked whether his\r\npatient had invited any one to sit with him when he expected\r\nsuch a visitation. He was answered in the negative.\r\nThe nature of the complaint, he said, was so singular, it was\r\nso likely to be imputed to fancy, or even to mental derangement,\r\nthat he had shrunk from communicating the circumstance\r\nto any one. \" Then,\" \"said the doctor, \" with your\r\npermission, I will dine with you to-day, <i>ttte-il-tite,</i> and we\r\nwill see if your malignant old woman will venture to join\r\nour company.\" The patient accepted the proposal with\r\nhope and gratitude, for he had expected ridicule rather than\r\nsympathy. They met at dinner, and Dr. Gregory, who\r\nsuspected some nervous disorder, exerted his powers of\r\nconversation, well known to be of the most varied and',1451401657,'','',0,'','',0,'','',0,'','',0,'','','P1.page_avail','',0,'',''),('027','027.png','28 <i>LETTERSCM</i>\r\n\r\nbrilliant character, to keep the attention of his host engaged,\r\nand prevent him from thinking on the approach of\r\nthe fated hour, to which he was accustomed to look forward\r\nwith so much terror. He succeeded in his purpose better\r\nthan he had hoped. The hour of six came almost unnoticed,\r\nand it was hoped might pass away without any\r\nevil consequence; but it was scarce a moment struck when\r\nthe owner of the house exclaimed, in an alarmed voice,\r\n\"The hag comes again!\" and dropped back in his chair in\r\na swoon, in the way he had himself described. The\r\nphysician caused him to be let blood, and satisfied himself\r\nthat the periodical shocks of which his patient complained\r\narose from a tendency to apoplexy.\r\n\r\nThe phantom with the crutch was only a species of\r\nmachinery, such as that with which fancy is found to supply\r\nthe disorder called <i>Ephialtes</i>, or nightmare, or indeed any\r\nother external impression upon our organs in sleep, which\r\nthe patient\'s morbid imagination may introduce into the\r\ndream preceding the swoon. In the nightmare an oppression\r\nand suffocation is felt, and our fancy instantly\r\nconjures up a spectre to lie on our bosom. In like manner\r\nit may be remarked, that any sudden noise which the\r\nslumberer hears, without being actually awakened by it--any\r\ncasual touch of his person occurring in the same\r\nmanner--becomes instantly adopted in his dream, and\r\naccommodated to the tenor of the current train of thought,\r\nwhatever that may happen to be; and nothing is more remarkable\r\nthan the rapidity with which imagination supplies\r\na complete explanation of the interruption, according to the\r\nprevious train of ideas expressed in the dream, even when\r\nscarce a moment of time is allowed for that purpose. In\r\ndreaming, for example, of a duel, the external sound\r\nbecomes, in the twinkling of an eye, the discharge of the\r\ncombatants\' pistols;--is an orator haranguing in his sleep,\r\nthe sound becomes the applause of his supposed audience <i>;\r\n--</i> is the dreamer wandering among supposed ruins, the',1451401657,'','',0,'','',0,'','',0,'','',0,'','','P1.page_avail','',0,'',''),('028','028.png','<i>DEMONOLOGY AND WITCHCRAFT</i>.  29\r\n\r\nnoise is that of the fall of some part of the mass. In short,\r\nan explanatory system is adopted during sleep with such\r\nextreme rapidity, that supposing the intruding alarm to have\r\nbeen the first call of some person to awaken the slumberer,\r\nthe explanation, though requiring some process of argument\r\nor deduction, is usually formed and perfect before the\r\nsecond effort of the speaker has restored the dreamer to the\r\nwaking world and its realities. So rapid and intuitive is the\r\nsuccession of ideas in sleep, as to remind us of the vision\r\nof the prophet Mahommed, in which he saw the whole\r\nwonders of heaven and hell, though the jar of water which\r\nfell when his ecstasy commenced, had not spilled its contents\r\nwhen he returned to ordinary existence.\r\n\r\nA second, and equally remarkable instance, was communicated\r\nto the author by the medical man under whose\r\nobservation it fell, but who was, of course, desirous to keep\r\nprivate the name of the hero of so singular a history. Of\r\nthe friend by whom the facts were attested I can only say,\r\nthat if I found myself at liberty to name him, the rank\r\nwhich he.holds in his profession, as well as his attainments\r\nin science and philosophy, form an undisputed claim to the\r\nmost implicit credit.\r\n\r\nIt was the fortune of this gentleman to be called in to\r\nattend the illness of a person now long deceased, who in\r\nhis lifetime stood, as I understand, high in a particular department\r\nof the law, which often placed the property of\r\nothers at his discretion and control, and whose conduct,\r\ntherefore, being open to public observation, hs had for\r\nmany years borne the character of a man of unusual steadiness,\r\ngood sense, and integrity. He was, at the time of my\r\nfriend\'s visits, confined principally to his sick-room, sometimes\r\nto bed, yet occasionally attending to business, and\r\nexerting his mind, apparently with all its usual strength and\r\nenergy, to the conduct of important affairs intrusted to him;\r\nnor did there, to a superficial observer, appear anything\r\nin his conduct, while so engaged, that could argue vacilla-',1451401657,'','',0,'','',0,'','',0,'','',0,'','','P1.page_avail','',0,'',''),('029','029.png','30 <i>LETTERS ON</i>\r\n\r\ntion of intellect, or depression of mind. His outward\r\nsymptoms of malady argued no acute or alarming disease.\r\nBut slowness of pulse, absence of appetite, difficulty of\r\ndigestion, and constant depression of spirits, seemed to\r\ndraw their origin from some hidden cause, which the\r\npatient was determined to conceal. The deep gloom of the\r\nunfortunate gentleman--the embarrassment, which he could\r\nnot conceal from his friendly physician--the briefness and\r\nobvious constraint with which he answered the interrogations\r\nof his medical adviser, induced my friend to take\r\nother methods for prosecuting his inquiries. He applied\r\nto the sufferer\'s family, to learn, if possible, the source of that\r\nsecret grief which was gnawing the heart and sucking the\r\nlife-blood of his unfortunate patient. The persons applied\r\nto, after conversing together previously, denied all knowledge\r\nof any cause for the burden which obviously affected\r\ntheir rela.tive. So far as they knew--and they thought they\r\ncould hardly be deceived--his worldly affairs were prosperous\r\n; no family loss had occurred which could be followed\r\nwith such persevering[1] distress; no entanglements of\r\naffection could be supposed to apply to his age, and no\r\nsensation of severe remorse could be consistent with his\r\ncharacter. The medical gentleman had finally recourse to\r\nserious argument with the invalid himself, and urged to\r\nhim the folly of devoting himself to a lingering and melancholy\r\ndeath, rather than tell the subject of affliction which\r\nwas thus wasting him. He specially pressed upon him the\r\ninjury which he was doing to his own character, by suffering\r\nit to be inferred that the secret cause of his dejection and\r\nits consequences was something too scandalous or flagitious\r\nto be made known, bequeathing in this manner to his family\r\na suspected and dishonoured name, and leaving a memory\r\nwith which might be associated the idea of guilt, which the\r\ncriminal had died without confessing. The patient, more\r\nmoved by this species of appeal than by any which had yet\r\nbeen urged, expressed his desire to speak out frankly to',1451401657,'','',0,'','',0,'','',0,'','',0,'','','P1.page_avail','',0,'',''),('030','030.png','<i>DEMONOLOGY AND WITCHCRAFT</i>. 31\r\n\r\nDr.----. Every one else was removed, and the door of\r\nthe sick-room made secure, when he began his confession\r\nin the following manner:--\r\n\"You cannot, my dear friend, be more conscious than I,\r\nthat I am in the course of dying under the oppression of\r\nthe fatal disease which consumes my vital powers; but\r\nneither can you understand the nature of my complaint,\r\nand manner in which it acts upon me, nor, if you did, I\r\nfear, could your zeal and skill avail to rid me of it.\"--\" It\r\nis possible,\" said the physician, \" that my skill may not\r\nequal my wish of serving you; yet medical science has\r\nmany resources, of which those unacquainted with its powers\r\nnever can form an estimate. But until you plainly tell me\r\nyour symptoms of complaint, it is impossible for either of\r\nus to say what may or may not be in my power, or within\r\nthat of medicine.\"--\" I may answer you,\" replied the\r\npatient, \" that my case is not a singular one, since we read\r\nof it in the famous novel of Le Sage. You remember,\r\ndoubtless, the disease of which the Duke d\'Olivarez is there\r\nstated to have died?\"--\" Of the idea,\" answered the medical\r\ngentleman, \" that he was haunted by an apparition, to the\r\nactual existence of which he gave no credit, but died, nevertheless,\r\nbecause he was overcome and heart-broken by its\r\nimaginary presence.\"--\" I, my dearest doctor,\" said the\r\nsick man, \" am in that very case; and so painful and\r\nabhorrent is the presence of the persecuting vision, that my\r\nreason is totally inadequate to combat the effects of my\r\nmorbid imagination, and I am sensible I am dying, a wasted\r\nvictim to an imaginary disease.\" The medical gentleman\r\nlistened with anxiety to his patient\'s statement, and for the\r\npresent judiciously avoiding any contradiction of the sick\r\nman\'s preconceived fancy, contented himself with more\r\nminute inquiry into the nature of the apparition with which\r\nhe conceived himself haunted,-and into the history of the\r\nmode by which so singular a disease had made itself master\r\nof his imagination, secured, as it seemed, by strong powers',1451401657,'','',0,'','',0,'','',0,'','',0,'','','P1.page_avail','',0,'',''),('031','031.png','32 <i>LETTERS ON</i>\r\n\r\nof the understanding, against an attack so irregular. The\r\nsick person replied by stating that its advances were gradual,\r\nand at first not of a terrible or even disagreeable character.\r\nTo illustrate this, he gave the following account of the progress\r\nof his disease:--\r\n\"My visions,\" he said, \" commenced two or three years\r\nsince, when I found myself from time to time embarrassed\r\nby the presence of a large cat, which came and disappeared\r\nI could not exactly tell how, till the truth was finally forced\r\nupon me, and I was compelled to regard it as no domestic\r\nhousehold cat, but as a bubble of the elements, which had\r\nno existence save in my deranged visual organs or depraved\r\nimagination. Still I had not that positive objection to the\r\nanimal entertained by a late gallant Highland chieftain, who\r\nhas been seen to change to all the colours of his own plaid\r\nif a cat by accident happened to be in the room with him,\r\neven though he did not see it. On the contrary, I am rather\r\na friend to cats, and endured with so much equanimity the\r\npresence of my imaginary attendant, that it had become\r\nalmost indifferent to me ; when, within the course of a few\r\nmonths, it gave place to, or was succeeded by, a spectre of\r\na more important sort, or which at least had a more imposing\r\nappearance. This was no other than the apparition of a\r\ngentleman-usher, dressed as if to wait upon a Lord Lieutenant\r\nof Ireland, a Lord High Commissioner of the Kirk, or any\r\nother who bears on his brow the rank and stamp of delegated\r\nsovereignty.\r\n\r\n\"This personage, arrayed in a court dress, with bag and\r\nsword, tamboured waistcoat, and chapeau-bras, glided\r\nbeside me like the ghost of Beau Nash; and, whether in\r\nmy own house or in another, ascended the stairs before me,\r\nas if to announce me in the drawing-room, and at sometimes\r\nappeared to mingle wiih the company, though it was sufficiently\r\nevident that they were not aware of his presence,\r\nand that I alone was sensible of the visionary honours which\r\nthis imaginary being seemed desirous to render me. This',1451401657,'','',0,'','',0,'','',0,'','',0,'','','P1.page_avail','',0,'',''),('032','032.png','<i>DEMONOLOGY AND WITCHCRAFT</i>. 33\r\n\r\nfreak of the fancy did not produce much impression on me,\r\nthough it led me to entertain doubts on the nature of my\r\ndisorder and alarm for the effect it might produce on my\r\nintellects. But that modification of my disease also had its\r\nappointed duration. After a few months the phantom of\r\nthe gentleman-usher was seen no more, but was succeeded\r\nby one horrible to the sight and distressing to the imagination,\r\nbeing no other than the image of death itself--the\r\napparition of a <i>skeleton</i>. Alone or in company,\" said the\r\nunfortunate invalid, \" the presence of this last phantom\r\nnever quits me. I in vain tell myself a hundred times over\r\nthat it is no reality, but merely an image summoned up by\r\nthe morbid acuteness of my own excited imagination and\r\nderanged organs of sight. But what avail such reflections,\r\nwhile the emblem at once and presage of mortality is before\r\nmy eyes, and while I feel myself, though in fancy only, the\r\ncompanion of a phantom representing a ghastly inhabitant\r\nof the grave, even while I yet breathe on the earth? Science,\r\nphilosophy, even religion, has no cure for such a disorder;\r\nand I feel too surely that I shall die the victim to so melancholy\r\na disease, although I have no belief whatever in the\r\nreality of the phantom which it places before me.\"\r\n\r\nThe physician was distressed to perceive, from these\r\ndetails, how strongly this visionary apparition was fixed in\r\nthe imagination of his patient. He ingeniously urged the\r\nsick man, who was then in bed, with questions concerning\r\nthe circumstances of the phantom\'s appearance, trusting he\r\nmi?ht lead him, as a sensible man, into such contradictions\r\n\r\nO \'                 \'\r\n\r\nand inconsistencies as might bring his common-sense, which\r\nseemed to be unimpaired, so strongly into the field as might\r\ncombat successfully the fantastic disorder which produced\r\nsuch fatal effects. \" This skeleton, then,\" said the doctor,\r\n\"seems to you to be always present to your eyes?\" \" It\r\nis my fate, unhappily,\" answered the invalid, \"always to sec\r\nit.\" \" Then I understand,\" continued the physician, \" it is\r\nnow present to your imagination?\" \" To my imagination\r\n\r\nB',1451401657,'','',0,'','',0,'','',0,'','',0,'','','P1.page_avail','',0,'',''),('033','033.png','34 <i>LETTERS ON</i>\r\n\r\nit certainly is so,\" replied the sick man. \" And in what\r\npart of the chamber do you now conceive the apparition to\r\nappear?\" the physician inquired. \"Immediately at the\r\nfoot of my bed. When the curtains are left a little open,\"\r\nanswered the invalid, \" the skeleton, to my thinking, is\r\nplaced between them, and fills the vacant space.\" \" You\r\nsay you are sensible of the delusion,\" said his friend<i>;\r\n\"</i> have you firmness to convince yourself of the truth of\r\nthis? Can you take courage enough to rise and place yourself\r\nin the spot so seeming to be occupied, and convince\r\nyourself of the illusion?\" The poor man sighed, and shook\r\nhis head negatively. \"Well,\" said the doctor, \"we will try\r\nthe experiment otherwise.\" Accordingly, he rose from his\r\nchair by the bedside, and placing himself between the two\r\nhalf-drawn curtains at the foot of the bed, indicated as the\r\nplace occupied by the apparition, asked if the spectre was\r\nstill visible? \" Not entirely so,\" replied the patient,\r\n\"because ycur person is betwixt him and me; but I observe\r\nhis skull peering above your shoulder.\"\r\n\r\nIt is alleged the man of science started on the instant,\r\ndespite philosophy, on receiving an answer ascertaining, with\r\nsuch minuteness, that the ideal spectre was close to his own\r\nperson. He resorted to other means of investigation and\r\ncure, but with equally indifferent success. The patient sunk\r\ninto deeper and deeper dejection, and died in the same distress\r\nof mind in which he had spent the latter months of his\r\nlife; and his case remains a melancholy instance of the\r\npower of imagination to kill the body, even when its fantastic\r\nteirors cannot overcome the intellect, of the unfortunate\r\npersons who suffer under them.
