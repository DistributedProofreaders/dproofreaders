# DP site configuration script
# ======================================================================

# This script is used to configure the DP site code by defining shell
# variables used to populate some template files.
#
# Make an editable copy of this file, put it *outside* your web
# server's doc root, and edit that file to configure your DP system.

# Set this file's variables to values that are appropriate for your
# system. In some cases, the setting that already appears here may
# be satisfactory. However, you will definitely need to change any value
# that refers to 'example.org', and any value that's a password.

# SECURITY WARNING:
# Because this file will contain various passwords, you should be
# careful not to allow it to be seen by unprivileged users. In
# particular, don't put it (or leave it) under your server's doc root.

# This file (or rather, your edited copy of it) is sourced by the scripts
# 'update_from_github' and 'configure'.  Those are Bourne Shell scripts,
# so you can use any syntax that /bin/bash allows.  However, in typical
# usage, you would merely assign literal values to shell variables.

# Bug/limitation: if a variables value contains an apostrophe, the
# configuration process will not work correctly. (Note that it's fine to
# use apostrophes to delimit string literals; they aren't part of the
# value.) This is unlikely to be a problem outside the "Identifying
# the Site" section.

# XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX

# This script exists simply to define variables for SETUP/configure, so
# disable unused variable warnings.

# Database access

# These parameters specify database connection and configuration settings.
# See SETUP/INSTALL.md for instructions on how to create the database
# and user.

# File and URL locations
# -----------------------------

# We don't require a particular arrangement of directories configured in
# this file, but we've found it convenient to make most of them siblings
# (children of a base directory), so the following code is slanted in that
# direction: if you choose to use this layout, then you only need to set
# $base_dir and $base_url, and most of the _DIR/_URL variables
# will be set accordingly.
base_dir=/home/$USER/public_html
base_url=http://www.example.org/~$USER

# For a variable whose name ends in _DIR, the value should be an absolute path
# to a directory in the local file system.
# For a variable whose name ends in _URL, the value should be an absolute URL.
# For a DIR/URL pair, the URL should resolve to the DIR.

# ----------------------------------------------------------------------

# Code location and URL access
# ----------------------------

_CODE_DIR=$base_dir/c
_CODE_URL=$base_url/c
# The location where the code was installed.
# (It corresponds to the root directory in the git repository
# and should contain directories such as 'pinc' and 'tools'.)

_DYN_DIR=$base_dir/d
_DYN_URL=$base_url/d
# This directory houses two classes of DP-related files that must be
# readable and writable by the web server.
#
# Optional user-supplied files that are only read by the code:
#
# --- $_DYN_DIR/code_images/page_header/$stage_id.<ext>
#     $_DYN_DIR/code_images/page_header/<locale>/$stage_id.<ext>
#         Images to show on stage pages. If the images don't exist nothing
#         is shown. Images with text can be localized by placing them in
#         locale-specific subdirectories. If a locale-free version is
#         found, that version is used before a locale-specific version.
#         The images can be of type png, jpg, or gif and are selected in
#         that order using those extensions.
#
#
# Files created and managed by the code:
#
# --- $_DYN_DIR/download_tmp/*_images.zip
#         Image zips, temporarily available for download.
#
# --- $_DYN_DIR/locale/
#         For the purposes pf 'gettext', this directory is bound to the
#         'messages' domain.
#
# --- $_DYN_DIR/pg/catalog.rdf
#         The current PG catalog, obtained from the PG site.
#
# --- $_DYN_DIR/stats/automodify_logs/*.txt
#         Logs of runs of automodify.php
#
# --- $_DYN_DIR/teams/avatar/*
# --- $_DYN_DIR/teams/icon/*
#         Avatar and icon images for teams.
#
# --- $_DYN_DIR/xmlfeeds/*.xml
#         News feeds for the site.

# XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX

# Forum configuration
# -------------------------

# The DP code uses a forum for authentication and facilitating communication
# about projects. The following types are supported:
#   phpbb3 -- phpBB versions 3.0, 3.1, 3.2, and 3.3
#   json -- a _test only_ forum used for development
_FORUM_TYPE=phpbb3

# phpBB3 forum configuration options
#
# Upon installation, phpBB tables are prefixed with a specific string.
# The DP code needs to know what this prefix is in order to access the
# tables directly.
#
# If you have installed the phpBB tables in their own database, include
# the database name and the prefix here. For example, if the phpBB
# were using the 'phpbb3db' database and a prefix of 'phpbb', set this
# value to phpbb3db.phpbb
_PHPBB_TABLE_PREFIX=phpbb
#
# Locations of the phpBB code via filesystem path and URL.
# These should not contain a trailing /
_PHPBB_DIR=$base_dir/phpBB3
_PHPBB_URL=$base_url/phpBB3

# JSON forum configuration options

# Location of JSON files, must be writable by web server
_JSON_USERS=
_JSON_POSTS=

# XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX

# Character suites
# ----------------

# To help provide better quality UTF-8 texts, the code requires project
# managers to select which characters are valid for a project. These
# characters are defined in a Character Suite. If you want all new
# projects to have specific character suites selected upon creation,
# specify them here using PHP array syntax within a string. An empty
# array can be used to disable default character suites. All character
# suites must be installed and enabled on the system.
# See SETUP/UNICODE.md for more information.

_DEFAULT_CHAR_SUITES='["basic-latin"]'

# XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX

# Identifying the Site
# --------------------

# (Bug/limitation: The values for the next three variables should avoid
# three characters that are special to HTML/XML: < > &.)

# Something like 'Distributed Proofreaders' would be good. It should
# make sense in contexts like 'Welcome to %s', and 'the %s website'.
_SITE_NAME=PICK_A_NAME

# Something like 'DP' would be good. It will be used in the HTML title
# of each page ('%s: Welcome') and in the subject line of emails.
_SITE_ABBREVIATION=PICK_AN_ABBREVIATION

# You can think of this as the "publishable" HTTP URL for the site.
# So far, it's used in email footers and project credits.
# -- It could be exactly the same as $_CODE_URL.
# -- Or it might be a more memorable or more permanent URL that simply
#    redirects to $_CODE_URL.
# -- Or it might be the address of some site-specific content, perhaps
#    a pre-introduction, which would presumably include a link to $_CODE_URL.
# (DP-US uses the second option, because PG didn't want us to use the first.)
_SITE_URL=$_CODE_URL

# XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX

# User registration
# -----------------

# User registration is done in two steps:
#   1) User fills out registration form; code sends activation email
#   2) User clicks activation URL; code adds account via forum software
#
# To help prevent bot registrations, you can create site-specific
# code for use in step 1 (such as blocking specific IPs or domains from
# registering, implementing CAPTCHs, etc).
#
# To do so, copy SETUP/site_registration_protection.php.example somewhere
# accessible to the web server, remove .example extension, implement the
# features you want, and update _SITE_REGISTRATION_PROTECTION_CODE to point
# to the absolute path of the file.
_SITE_REGISTRATION_PROTECTION_CODE=

# XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX

# Uploading and Creating Projects
# -------------------------------

# To load images and text into projects, these files must reside on the
# web server. There are two common ways to accomplish this:
#   1) Via the built-in project upload script (recommended)
#   2) Via an FTP server that you configure and manage separately
#
# Previously at pgdp.net, Project Managers were given access to a shared
# ftp-only "uploads" account. Each PM created a personal directory (named
# according to their DP login id) within the shared account's home
# directory. This has since been replaced with the remote_file_manager.php
# script.

# The location where project information (text and images) are written
# to by remote_file_manager.php and read from for loading into projects.
# The web server must have read/write permissions on this directory.
# If using FTP, this should be the root directory for the
# _UPLOADS_ACCOUNT user.
_UPLOADS_DIR=/home/dpscans

# If using FTP, set the following parameters to have them echoed to
# users as reminders. If _UPLOADS_HOST is blank, these will not be
# displayed to users.
_UPLOADS_HOST=www.example.org
_UPLOADS_ACCOUNT=dpscans
_UPLOADS_PASSWORD=PICK_A_PASSWORD

# remote_file_manager.php will scan uploaded files for viruses
# if an antivirus scanner, like clamscan, is installed. Any scanner
# will work as long as it accepts the following syntax
#   av_executable -- filename
# and returns 0 on pass and non-zero on failure.
_ANTIVIRUS_EXECUTABLE=

# ----------------------------------------------------------------------

_PROJECTS_DIR=$base_dir/projects
_PROJECTS_URL=$base_url/projects

# When you "Create a Project", the code creates a directory for that
# project as a sub-directory of $_PROJECTS_DIR.
#
# When you "Add text and images" to that project (from a specified
# directory under $_UPLOADS_DIR), the code looks at the data, copies
# image files into the project directory, and loads text data into the
# database.
#
# The project directory also holds other files relating to the project.

# ----------------------------------------------------------------------

_EXTERNAL_CATALOG_LOCATOR='lx2.loc.gov:210/LCDB'

# When you Create a Project, you have the option of searching an
# external (Z39.50-enabled) catalog for bibliographic information.
# This variable specifies the catalog to search.

# It should be a locator in the form 'host[:port][/database]', suitable
# for passing to 'yaz_connect'.

# To disable external search at project-creation time, leave this
# variable empty.

# See http://www.loc.gov/z3950/lcserver.html for US Library of Congress
# server addresses and URLs.

# XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX

# Proofreading Projects
# ---------------------

_PRECEDING_PROOFER_RESTRICTION=not_immediately_preceding

# When a user asks to proofread a page in a project, the code chooses
# which page to assign to the user. Generally, it just chooses the "next"
# (i.e., lowest-numbered) available page, but it can be configured (with
# this setting) to avoid pages that the user has worked on before.
# Specifically, there are three recognized values for this setting:
# --- empty string: Anyone can work on any page in any round,
#     regardless of which pages they've done in previous rounds.
# --- 'not_immediately_preceding': All pages are available, except those
#     completed by the current user in the round immediately preceding
#     the current round (where the definition of "immediately preceding"
#     takes skipped rounds into account).
# --- 'not_previously_proofed': All pages are available, except those
#     which have been completed by the current user in any prior round.

# ----------------------------------------------------------------------

_PUBLIC_PAGE_DETAILS=false

# When a user proofs a page, the site records their username, and can
# display this in various places, including the page details table and
# concatenated text files.  This setting controls the visibility of
# those names.
# If `true`, all logged-in users can see all names for all pages in all
#     projects.
# If `false`, the proofreader names for a given page in a given project
#     are visible only to:
#     --- Site Administrators and Project Facilitators;
#     --- the project's PM, PPer, and PPVer; and
#     --- any other user that worked on the same page.

# ----------------------------------------------------------------------

# In the proofreading interface, the WordCheck functionality relies on
# a local installation of 'aspell'...
